Test Plan for Dockable Perspective Save/Restore Framework.

Create 2 views in jEdit.
Dock the following dockables:
View 1:
    ProjectViewer: left (open to Project #1)
    Sidekick: Right
    Console: Bottom
    ErrorList: top
View 2:
    ProjectViewer: left (open to Project #2)
    SideKick: Right
    Console: Bottom
    ErrorList: Top

Ensure the splitters are far enough away from the edge that you can see a lot of stuff in each dockable area.

Quit jEdit.

Re-Run jEdit.

Verify that all 4 dockables are visible and that the vertical sliding positions are restored.
Verify that the preferred docked window placement is correct on both views.
Verify that the correct Projects are opened in each View

Change to File System Browser.
Set FSB to different directories in each view.
Exit and re-run jEdit.
Verify the correct paths are restored in each FSB (?)
