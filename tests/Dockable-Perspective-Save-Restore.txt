Test Plan for Dockable Perspective Save/Restore Framework with 3 views.

Query: Should the persepctive manager also remember the layout of the last closed View(s) as invisible but ready to be "popped" from the stack layout when the user does a "new view"?

Query: When the user creates a new view, and that stack is empty, should it create a new view that is the same as the current view?


Sub Verify:
    Verify in each view that the same dockables are restored.
    Verify that the geometry of each view is restored.
    Verify the same # of split panes, position of split panes, and the same buffers are open
    Ensure the splitters are far enough away from the edge that you can see a lot of stuff in each dockable area.
    Verify that restored dockables have vertical sliding positions restored
    Verify a correct path is showing in FSB.
    Verify that the preferred docked window placement is correct on both views. (general options - view)
    Verify the correct project is open in each PV (?)
    Verify Clicking on a dockable in a region that has no visible dockable, that it opens to a size that is non-zero (remembered from when it was last open).    
    
Run jEdit.
Create View 1: EditPane 1: File #1
    I/O Progress and Activity Log: top *invisible* (non-zero when visible)
    ProjectViewer: left (open to Project #1)
    FSB: Right (open to Path #1)
    Console: Bottom showing (errorlist invisible)
Create View 2: Split Pane Files#1, #2
    Activity Log: top (i/o progress monitor invisible
    ProjectViewer: left (open to Project #2)
    FSB: Right (Open to Path #2)
    ErrorList: Bottom showing (console invisible)
Create View #3: EditPane File #3
    I/O Progress Monitor: top visible (activity log invisible)
    SideKick: left visible (PV invisible)
    FSB: Right (open to Path #3)
    Console, ErrorList: bottom *INVISIBLE*. (non-zero when visible)

File - Quit jEdit.
Re-Run jEdit.
Verify 2 views: #1, #2, #3
Close View #2, focus on View #1
New View
Verify View#1,#1,#3
Close View #3
Focus on View #2, make changes so it is distinguishable from #1
New View 
Verify view #1, #2, #2
