Test Plan for Dockable Perspective Save/Restore Framework.

Create 2 views in jEdit.
Dock the following dockables:
View 1:
    Activity Log: top (invisible)
    ProjectViewer: left (open to Project #1)
    FSB: Right (open to Path #1)
    Console: Bottom showing 
    ErrorList: Bottom invisible
View 2:
    Activity Log: top (visible)
    ProjectViewer: left (open to Project #2)
    FSB: Right (Open to Path #2)
    Console: Bottom invisible
    ErrorList: Bottom showing

Ensure the splitters are far enough away from the edge that you can see a lot of stuff in each dockable area.

Quit jEdit.

Re-Run jEdit.

Verify in each view that the same dockables are restored.
Verify that restored dockables have vertical sliding positions are restored in each view.
Verify the correct path is showing in each FSB.
Verify that the preferred docked window placement is correct on both views.
Verify the correct project is open in each PV (?)
