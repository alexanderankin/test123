Test Plan for Dockable Perspective Save/Restore Framework.

Create 2 views in jEdit.
Dock the following dockables:
View 1:
    Activity Log: top (invisible)
    ProjectViewer: left (open to Project #1)
    FSB: Right (open to Path #1)
    Console: Bottom showing 
    ErrorList: Bottom invisible
View 2:
    Activity Log: top (visible)
    ProjectViewer: left (open to Project #2)
    FSB: Right (Open to Path #2)
    Console: Bottom invisible
    ErrorList: Bottom showing
View #3:
    I/O Progress Monitor: top visible (activity log invisible)
    SideKick: left visible (PV invisible)
    FSB: Right (open to Path #3)
    Console: Bottom visible (errorlist invisible)
    
Close View#3
Ensure the splitters are far enough away from the edge that you can see a lot of stuff in each dockable area.

File - Quit jEdit.

Re-Run jEdit.

    Verify in each view that the same dockables are restored.
