    - error-out when unexpected option given
  - resource file
- jdiff.exe 
  - add build/version number, and -version arg
  - is broken
  - needs to support waiting for the server.
  - splitter isn't properly aligned when diff is displayed 
    (don't know what can be done about this)
  - resource file
- jecfg.exe
  - update command line as text changes in boxes
- picking up JAVA_HOME doesn't work
- investigate using -run=<diff script>, instead of polling 
  for server file
- icons for jeditext (started -- works for "edit", but need better icons)?
- make sure no buffer overruns are possible
- jeditlib
  - move helper function declarations from .h to .c
  - maybe compile as a DLL once things are deemed stable
- remove old jEditLauncher registry settings, when installing
- add [lots] more tests
- use: #define DllExport   __declspec( dllexport ) instead of .def file
- separate option parsing into its own file
- fix doxygen markup (maybe use SVN code for example)
