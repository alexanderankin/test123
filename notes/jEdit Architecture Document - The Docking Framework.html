An edit pane manages a set of buffers, and may optionally contain a <strong>buffer switcher</strong>, which is a combo-box for selecting the buffer to be edited. When a buffer is selected in the combo-box, the edit pane sets the text area to edit the selected buffer.</li><li>Edit
panes can be split vertically or horizontally; there are buttons for
this on the tool bar. Splitting an edit pane causes its screen area to
be split between itself and the new edit pane, with a draggable
splitter separating them.The arrangement of split edit panes inside a view&nbsp; is called the&nbsp; <strong>split configuration</strong> of the view.</li><li>The edit panes inside a view are all children of a <strong>center panel</strong> container. Dockable windows are always placed around this center panel.</li><li>The
dockable window manager is the part of the view that contains the
center panel, the dockable windows, and optionally the tool bars
(depending on the optional "Alternate tool bar placement").</li><li></li></ul></body></html>
