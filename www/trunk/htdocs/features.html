<h1>jEdit Features</h1>

<h2>General</h2>

<ul>
<li>Combines the best functionality of Unix, Windows and MacOS text editors.
<li>Runs on any operating system with a Java 1.6 or higher virtual
machine - this includes MacOS X, Linux, Unix, VMS and Windows.
<li>Efficient keyboard shortcuts for everything, with predefined keymaps for 
Emacs, Intellij IDEA, and Mac OSX <b>(5.0)</b>
<li>Comprehensive online help
<li>Unlimited undo/redo
<li>Copy and paste with an unlimited number of clipboards (known as "registers")
<li>Register contents are saved across editing sessions 
<li>"Kill ring" automatically remembers previously deleted text 
<li>Rich set of keyboard commands for manipulating entire words, lines and
paragraphs at a time
<li>"Markers" for remembering positions in files to return to later
<li>Marker locations are saved across editing sessions
<li>Any number of editor windows may be open, each window may be split into
several areas, each area can view a different file and keep track of an
independent set of buffers. Alternatively, different
locations in one file can be viewed in more than one area
<li>Multiple open windows and split windows are remembered between editing
sessions 
<li>Rectangular selection
<li>Multiple selection (sometimes known as "discontinuous" or "additive"
selection) for manipulating several chunks of text at once
<li>Word wrap
</ul>

There are even more contributed syntax highlighting modes at the
<a href="http://community.jedit.org/modules.php?op=modload&name=downloads&file=index&req=viewdownload&cid=9">jEdit community</a>
web site.

<h2>Source Code Editing</h2>

<ul>
<li>Intelligent bracket matching skips quoted literals and comments
<li>Auto indent
<li>Commands for shifting the indent left and right
<li>Commands for commenting out code
<li>Soft tabs option
<li>Abbreviations
<li>Folding, with two fold modes: indent-based, and explicit (where
the buffer is parsed for "{{{" and "}}}")
</ul>

<h2>Search and Replace</h2>

<ul>
<li>Both literal and regular expression search and replace supported
<li>Multiple file search and replace; search in either the current file, all
open files, or all files in a directory
<li>"HyperSearch" option to show all found matches in a list
<li>Reverse search supported
<li>Incremental search supported
<li>Option to replace occurrences of a regular expression with the return value
of a BeanShell script. As far as I know, no other text editor offers comparable
functionality!
</ul>

<h2>File Management</h2>

<ul>
<li>Any number of files can be opened at once
<li>Supports a large number of character encodings including UTF8 and UTF16
<li>Automatic detection of several character encodings
<li>Automatic compression and decompression of GZipped (.gz) files
<li>Any character encoding supported by Java can be used to load and save files
<li>Multi-threaded I/O system supports pluggable "virtual file systems" for
listing directories and loading files:

<ul>
<li>FTP plugin adds support for loading and saving files on FTP servers
<li>Archive plugin adds read-only support for loading files from ZIP and TAR
archives
</ul>

<li>Custom file system browser component used in open and save dialog boxes
<li>Powerful keyboard navigation in the file system browser
<li>Files can be deleted and renamed, and new directories can be created from
the file system browser
</ul>

<h2>Customization</h2>

<ul>
<li>Syntax highlighting modes are defined in XML files and new ones are very
easy to write
<li>Many editor settings can be set on a global, per-mode, or per-file basis
<li>Fully customizable keyboard shortcuts
<li>Fully customizable tool bar and right-click context menu
<li>Macros to automate complex editing tasks can be written in
the <a href="http://www.beanshell.org">BeanShell</a> scripting language
<li>Macros can be recorded from user actions
</ul>

<h2>Extensibility</h2>

<ul>
<li>Plugins can turn jEdit into a very advanced XML/HTML editor, or a full-fledged IDE, with compiler, code
completion, context-sensitive help, debugging, visual diff, and many language-specific tools tightly integrated with the editor. </li>

<li>More than 200 plugins are <a href="http://plugins.jedit.org">already available</a>
that add a variety of features to jEdit. </li>
<li>The "Plugin manager" feature downloads and installs plugins (and updates) from within jEdit automatically. </li>
<li>Plugin windows can either be shown as separate, top-level frames, or as
"docked windows" inside the jEdit editor window
</ul>
