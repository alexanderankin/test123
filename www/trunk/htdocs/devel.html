<a name="help" >
<h2> Want to join us? Help Wanted! </h2>
</a>

<p> Specific requests for help can be found on the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/jedit/index.php?title=Help_Wanted">wiki page</a>. </p>

<h2>Becoming a jEdit developer</h2>

<p> <a href="https://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/jedit/index.php?title=Roadmap">Core Development Road Map</a> contains a road map of what needs to be done, and who is paying attention to what in the core. </p>

<p>jEdit is always looking for more people to help. If you examine the  <a href="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=588&amp;atid=350588">Feature Requests</a> and open <a href="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=588&amp;atid=100588">Bugs</a>, you will see that many of them are "unassigned". </p>

<p> Most of our code is managed using an open-source tool called Subversion. It is recommended you learn the basics of this tool, to help you keep up to date on the latest changes from other developers, as well as to generate patches against specific file revisions.
</p>

<p> Slava is no longer actively involved in development, and many other plugin authors have also left the community and are not maintaining their plugins. Some plugins have a new maintainer, others have been replaced by newer plugins. Once you become a developer, we can always use help by closing some of these open issues. You can make comments on them, or if you want to assign yourself tracker items, feel free. </p>

<p>Inclusion in the jEdit "development team" is informal and open to anyone. You can "join" simply by <a
href="index.php?page=feedback">subscribing to the <tt>jEdit-devel</tt> and
<tt>jEdit-users</tt> mailing lists</a>. Your level and focus of involvement is entirely up to you. For active developers, it is also highly recommended you join <a href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/mailman/listinfo/jedit-cvs">jedit-commits</a> which includes commit logs on the subversion repository. Watching this list allows you to see clearly who are the active developers, and precisely what they are working on.
</p>

<p>Membership in the <a
href="http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/jedit/">jEdit</a>
SourceForge project is granted on an as-needed basis. If you join the jEdit mailing lists, participate, and end up working on one or more plugins (either your own, or existing ones), then you can ask one of the administrators of the project for access to the CVS or SVN repository. If you still find yourself with inadquate permissions to do your work, ask one of the project administrators for the permissions you need. This includes access to statistics, databases, etc.
</p>

<a name="contributions" >
<h2>Specific contributions</h2>
</a>

<h3>Reviewing other bug reports, patches</h3>

<p> Some open patches need to be reviewed, some bugs can use extra information. 
A review of the open tickets in trackers will quickly show you what is on 
the mind of other users and developers. You can pick something to do based on
that. </p>

<h3>Writing/updating edit modes</h3>

<p>Writing syntax highlighting modes is covered in detail in the jEdit user's guide.
If you want your mode to be included with jEdit, send it along with a mode catalog
entry, and an attached example file (for exotic languages) containing a code snippet
in that language for testing, to the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=588&amp;atid=300588">jedit patches</a>
tracker. </p>

<h3>Writing macros</h3>

<p>Macro development is covered in the jEdit user's guide. Macros should only
be used for simple tasks; more complicated features should be coded as
plugins. If you want your macro to be included with jEdit, send it to
<a href="mailto:jedit-devel@lists.sourceforge.net">jedit-devel</a> or the
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=588&amp;atid=300588">jedit patches</a>
tracker. </p>

<h3>Writing plugins</h3>

<p>Plugin development is covered in the jEdit user's guide, but the information there only scratches the surface, since plugins
can do anything any Java program can. You can learn more by looking at the sourcecode of another plugin which does something similar to what you want. </p>

<p>
Once your plugin is in a minimally useful state, send a message to the
<tt>jEdit-users</tt> mailing list with a
short summary of your plugin, and possibly a download link. Remember to
release early and often - feedback at early stages of development is
always a good thing.
</p>

<h3> Fixing plugin or core bugs </h3>

<p> Even if you can't fix a bug yourself, you can still help in its eventual resolution by adding useful comments or metadata to the existing tracker items.  If you want to help in categorizing or closing bugs, just ask for tracker admin permissions from one of the existing project admins. </p>

<p>
If you want to make changes to existing plugins, or jEdit itself, make sure that you are working on the latest released (i.e. development) versions. Until you are ready to commit directly, you can submit your patches via the
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=588&amp;atid=300588">jedit patches</a> tracker, as an attachment or a comment in the actual tracker item. After you have submitted a few patches, you can ask for permission to commit directly.
</p>

<a name="patches" >
<h3>Creating and submitting Patches</h3>
</a>
<p> We prefer patches which are generated against the latest "trunk" in subversion. By checking out a copy of the source and making changes to your local copy, you can create a patch by simply typing <tt>svn diff</tt>, (or <tt>cvs diff</tt>, if it's in CVS) from the root directory of your project. This command will give you context, as well as version numbers for all differences between your versions and the versions you checked out from the repository. Redirect this command to a file and attach it with proper documentation to a <a href="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=588&amp;atid=300588">patches</a> tracker item.
</p>

<h3>Adding plugins to the Subversion repository</h3>

<p>To get an account on the sourceforge jedit Subversion repository, first you need a <a href="http://www.sourceforge.net">SourceForge</a>
user account.</p>

<p> For your own plugin, add a file named "README.<i>name of plugin</i>" to the
"guidelines" module detailing your policy regarding others making changes; if they should ask for permission first, if they should commit directly or send a patch, and so on.</p>

<p>Once you feel your plugin is reasonably complete (this should be determined partly by feedback you get during the development process), you can post your submission on the submissions tracker.  At this point, it will become a candidate for release on <a href="http://plugins.jedit.org">plugin central</a>.
See <a href="http://plugins.jedit.org/releasing.php">this page</a> to find out how.</p>
