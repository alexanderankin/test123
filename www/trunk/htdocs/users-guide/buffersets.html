        displays the contents of a BufferSet. In jEdit 4.2, all EditPane buffer switchers
        showed the same BufferSet: a global list of all buffers that were opened from any EditPane in any View. 
        When using many Views and EditPanes, this resulted in large lists of buffers, and made
        the next/previous buffer actions useless with many views, EditPanes and buffers. 
        </p><p> In jEdit 4.3, it is possible to have different scopes for the BufferSets of each EditPane. The three scopes are: </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p> <span class="bold"><strong>Global</strong></span>: Includes all buffers open from any EditPane. </p></li><li><p> <span class="bold"><strong>View</strong></span>: EditPanes in the same View share the same
        BufferSet. Opening a buffer in one View will not affect the non-global scope BufferSets in EditPanes of other
        Views. </p></li><li><p><span class="bold"><strong>EditPane</strong></span>: Each EditPane can have its own independent BufferSet, although any buffers that are opened from it should also show up in the Global BufferSet..
        </p></li></ol></div><p> The default Buffer Set scope for newly created EditPanes is global by default, and can be
        changed from <span class="guimenu"><strong>Utilities</strong></span>&gt;<span class="guimenuitem"><strong>Global Options</strong></span>
        &gt; <span class="guimenuitem"><strong>View</strong></span> &gt; <span class="guilabel"><strong>BufferSet scope for new
        EditPanes</strong></span>. </p><p> New BufferSets are initially empty, or populated with a copy of the 
        existing BufferSet. This behavior can be changed from 
        <span class="guimenuitem"><strong>Global Options</strong></span> &gt; <span class="guimenuitem"><strong>View</strong></span> &gt; 
        <span class="guilabel"><strong>New BufferSets contain: copies of current BufferSet</strong></span>. </p><p> The statusbar shows you which BufferSet scope is active for the current EditPane 
        (look for the letter "G", "E" or "V"). Double-clicking on that
        will allow you to change the buffer set. Also, the scope for the current EditPane BufferSet can be changed from <span class="guimenu"><strong>View</strong></span>&gt;<span class="guimenu"><strong>Buffer Sets</strong></span> &gt;
        <span class="guimenu"><strong>(Global|View|EditPane) Buffer Set</strong></span>. </p><p> A new BufferSet can be created in a number of ways, such as when a new
        View is created (and the default BufferSet scope is not global) or when the
        View is split (and the default BufferSet scope is EditPane), or when the
        BufferSet scope is changed to EditPane via the statusbar or menu action. </p><p> <span class="guimenu"><strong>File</strong></span> &gt; <span class="guimenuitem"><strong>Close</strong></span> behavior has changed in 4.3pre15: now it will remove the current buffer from the EditPane's BufferSet. If it
        was the last BufferSet to contain that buffer, the buffer is also closed. </p><p> The <span class="guimenu"><strong> File </strong></span> &gt; <span class="guimenuitem"><strong>Close (global)</strong></span> action closes the buffer in all EditPanes, as the regular <span class="guimenu"><strong> File </strong></span> &gt; <span class="guimenuitem"><strong>Close</strong></span> action did before. </p><p> <span class="guimenuitem"><strong>Clear BufferSet except active</strong></span> will clear the BufferSet of the
        current EditPane by performing a <span class="guimenuitem"><strong>Close</strong></span> on all items except those buffers which are displayed in another active EditPane. </p><p> The buffer sets feature helps keep the buffer lists local and manageable when using
        jEdit in a multiple-View and multiple-EditPane environment. </p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="buffers.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="basics.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="docking.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Switching Buffers </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Window Docking</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
