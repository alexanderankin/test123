This is a program to exploit the XML Export from Sourceforge
to generate offline browseable views of the Trackers.

It is meant for people going on vacation with their laptops
and wanting to hack on jEdit without or with limited internet access.
I found it useful to unearth old bugs.

The tables can be sorted by clicking on the headers.
Hold Shift to be able to sort on multiple columns.

How to use this ?

1 - install SaxonPlugin in jEdit
2 - ./filter.sh path/to/sf/export.xml .
3 - ./transform.sh filtered.xml res
4 - firefox res/index.html

Includes an unmodified version of jQuery TableSorter plugin:
