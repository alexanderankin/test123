   Exactly how jEdit is started depends on the operating system. For example, on Unix you can run &#8220;<span class="quote">jedit</span>&#8221; at the command line,
   or select jEdit from a menu; on Windows, you can
   use the jEditLauncher package, which is documented in
   <a href="starting-windows.html" title="Starting jEdit on Windows">the section called &#8220;Starting jEdit on Windows&#8221;</a>.
  </p><p>
   If jEdit is started while another copy is already running, control is
   transferred to the running copy, and a second instance is not loaded.
   This saves time and memory if jEdit is started multiple times.
   Communication between instances of jEdit is implemented using
   TCP/IP sockets; the initial instance is known as the
   <i class="firstterm">server</i>, and subsequent invocations are
   <i class="firstterm">clients</i>.
  </p><p>
   If you find yourself launching and exiting jEdit a lot, the startup time can get a bit bothersome.
   If the <b class="userinput"><tt>-background</tt></b> command line switch is specified,
   jEdit will continue running and waiting for client requests even
   after all editor windows are closed. When run in background mode,
   you can open and close jEdit any number of times, only having
   to wait for it to start the first time. The downside of this
   is increased memory usage.
  </p><p>
   When running on MacOS X, the <b class="userinput"><tt>-background</tt></b> command-line switch is active by default, so that jEdit conforms to the platform convention that programs should stay open until the <span><b class="guimenuitem">Quit</b></span> command is explicitly invoked by the user, even if all windows are closed. To disable background mode on MacOS X, use the <b class="userinput"><tt>-nobackground</tt></b> switch.
  </p><p>
   For more information about command line switches that control the
   server feature, see <a href="cli-usage.html" title="Command Line Usage">the section called &#8220;Command Line Usage&#8221;</a>.
   Note that if you are using <span class="application">jEditLauncher</span>
   to start jEdit on Windows, this switch cannot be specified on the
   MS-DOS prompt command line when starting jEdit; it must be set as described
   in <a href="launcher-starting.html" title="Starting jEdit">the section called &#8220;Starting jEdit&#8221;</a>.
  </p><p>
   jEdit remembers open buffers, views and split window configurations between editing sessions, so you can get back to work immediately after starting jEdit. This feature can be
   disabled in the <span><b class="guibutton">General</b></span> pane of the
   <span><b class="guimenu">Utilities</b></span>&gt;<span><b class="guimenuitem">Global Options</b></span>
   dialog box see <a href="global-opts.html#general-pane" title="The General Pane">the section called &#8220;The General Pane&#8221;</a>.
  </p><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>The edit server and security</b></p><p>
    Since Java does not provide any interprocess communication facility other than TCP/IP, jEdit takes extra precautions to prevent remote attacks.
   </p><p>
    Not only does the edit server pick a random TCP port number on startup,
    it also requires that clients provide an <i class="firstterm">authorization
    key</i>; a randomly-generated number only accessible to
    processes running on the local machine.
    So not only will &#8220;<span class="quote">bad guys</span>&#8221; have to guess a 64-bit integer,
    they will need to get it right on the first try; the edit server
    shuts itself off upon receiving an invalid packet.
   </p><p>
    In environments that demand absolute security, the edit server can be
    disabled by specifying the <b class="userinput"><tt>-noserver</tt></b> command line switch.
