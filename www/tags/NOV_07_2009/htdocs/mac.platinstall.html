<p>Once you've downloaded the Mac OS X package, StuffIt Expander should
automatically uncompress the file and leave you with a file called
jEdit.dmg. If it doesn't, you can either open the downloaded file
with StuffIt Expander, or uncompress it from the command line using:</p>

<pre>gunzip <i>filename</i>.dmg.gz</pre>

<p>Open jEdit.dmg. When the jEdit drive image appears on your desktop,
copy the jEdit folder on it to your Applications folder (or where
ever you'd like install it).</p>

<p>Simply run the jEdit application in the jEdit folder, and code away...</p>
