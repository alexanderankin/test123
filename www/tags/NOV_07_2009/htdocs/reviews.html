<h1>jEdit Reviews</h1>

<p>jEdit was reviewed at <a href="http://www.communitymx.com/content/article.cfm?cid=7302C">CommunityMX</a>:</p>

<blockquote><i>
JEdit is a great open source application, one of my long-time favorites. It may also be the single best Java-based application I've seen, in the way it balances capability and performance (JEdit is not the resource or memory hog that some Java programs have been in the past). In fact, JEdit is quite competitive with proprietary programs, so web developers on any platform would benefit by giving it a try.

<blockquote><i>
jEdit is a open-source multi-platform, multi-language programmers editor and development environment. Coded in Java, it's a fine example of a Java desktop tool that looks good, is packed full of useful functionality and has snappy response times. If the mere thought of running a Java app makes your blood run cold then think again - more than one user has been forced to think again after giving jEdit a spin. Of course being coded in Java means that it is platform independent, and can run on any platform that has a run-time environment, from Windows, Linux, BSD, Solaris to VMS, OS2 and Mac OSX. If you code on multiple platforms then this is a tool that you can probably use across all of them.

<p>jEdit won the <a href="http://www.resource-centre.net/sotm/sept04.shtml">Resource Centre UK -- Shareware of the Month</a> award in September 2004:</p>

<blockquote><i>
At first I was dubious about using an editor which relied on the Java Runtime Environment, as I am very possessive of system resources, but after giving it a try, I am glad I put that concern out of my head. JEdit is packed full of functionality, more than I required, and it is amazingly bug-free. I did initially come across a syntax highlighting bug, but after reporting it to the jEdit team, it was fixed for the next pre-release (number 14, so you can tell how hard they work on this editor).

<p>An article about <a href="http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-cpyide/">Python IDEs</a> hosted on IBM DeveloperWorks mentions jEdit:</p>

<blockquote>
<i>
 Some of the nicest Python-specific functionality for jEdit lies in the Jython plugin. A complete version of Jython is packaged up as a jEdit plugin. Of course, you are stuck at the latest version of Jython itself for this approach, which as of this writing lagged at 2.1 (compared to CPython's recent 2.3 release). Still, if you can live with the Jython version, you can do substantial Python development without leaving jEdit. Beyond the interactive shell you can open, you can also run a Python buffer, with the output appearing either in the interactive shell or in a new buffer (to save for later, perhaps). Little touches like saving an interactive session are also handy.

<p>A review of jEdit 4.1 has been published on
<a href="http://www.tinyminds.org/modules.php?op=modload&name=Reviews&file=index&req=showcontent&id=26">TinyMinds.org</a>.
</p>

<blockquote>
<i>
At work I have to use Win2K but at home Linux/KDE is my desktop of choice. Since
jEdit is written in Java I can use it seamlessly on both platforms. Some people
complain that Java-based editors are slow or sluggish when compared to editors
built with C or C++, but I haven't seen any discernable slow down.

<p><a href="http://www.linuxworld.com/2003/0129.petreley.html">LinuxWorld</a>
published a comparison of jEdit and two other text editors written in Java:</p>

<blockquote>
<i>
Jedit is still my favorite programmer's editor, so I recommend you look at it first.
</i>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p>jEdit was praised in another
<a href="http://www.linuxworld.com/site-stories/2003/0121.petreley.html">LinuxWorld</a>
story:</p>

<blockquote><i> If all the many excellent GUI-based editors written in C and C++
were not appealing enough to draw me away from my console favorites, surely a
Java-based editor would be out of the question, don't you think? Yet, precisely
the opposite turned out to be the case. I now do all my coding with a Java-based
open-source programmer's editor called Jedit. </i></blockquote>

<p>jEdit was a finalist in the <a href="http://www.sys-con.com/xml">XML-J
Readers' Choice Awards</a>. The winners and finalists are mentioned in the
November 2002 issue (which is not available online unfortunately).</p>

of <a href="http://www.sys-con.com/java">Java
Developer's Journal</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<i>
I'm currently working with version 4 of jEdit and it's a joy to
use. In addition to being a normal source editor with syntax highlighting, it
has the ability to use plug-ins. If there's one plug-in I would advise you to
download, it's JavaStyle as it tidies up your code layout and also inserts the
relevant JavaDoc comments.

<p>jEdit was reviewed in the
<a href="http://www.linuxformat.co.uk/archives/LXF29.hotpicks.pdf">
July 2002 edition</a> of LinuxFormat magazine:</p>

<blockquote>
<i>At the risk of being branded a heretic, I am going to suggest that jEdit is
currently the best text editor available for Linux.

<p>A <a href="http://www.linuxmuse.com/articles.php?action=section&article=14&num=1">review</a>
of jEdit was posted on the
<a href="http://www.linuxmuse.com">LinuxMuse</a> web site:</p>

<blockquote><i>
"Learning to use Jedit turned out to be very easy thanks to the
fantastic documentation. As I'm sure you know, documentation often is a weakness
with free software. Jedit is definitely an exception to that."

<p>A <a

of jEdit was posted on the <a href="http://www.macosxhints.com">Mac OS X
Hints</a> web site:</p>

<blockquote><i>
"Syntax coloring is provided for more languages than I can
name, and you can create your own schemes if you don't like the provided
version."
</i></blockquote>

<hr>

<p>jEdit was mentioned in an
<a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/mac/2002/04/16/osx_java.html?page=2">article</a>
on the
<a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/">O'Reilly Network</a> about Java IDEs for
Mac OS X:

<blockquote>
<i>
"The strength of jEdit for Java developers comes from the plug-ins contributed
by the community."

<p>
jEdit was praised by the editor in the
<a href="http://www.sys-con.com/java/article2a.cfm?id=1298&count=3723&tot=5&page=3">February 2002
issue</a> of the <a href="http://www.sys-con.com/java">Java
Developer's Journal</a>:

<blockquote>
<i>
"Wow. This is how software should work. Not only is JEdit
feature-rich, but for those of you who still want to have your cake and eat it
too, just download a simple plug-in from the masses that are available and
restart. And you know the easy bit? It's all done from within the editor itself.
No buggering around with URLs and complicated README files. It's an absolute
joy."

<!-- <p>jEdit 2.5 (yes, this review is really old)

<blockquote>
<i>
"It runs fast enough, and it has a good interface and a very nice range
of features. In fact, jEdit has a lot of cutting-edge and sophisticated features,
many beyond other editors I have reviewed. jEdit just might be the best text
editor I have found yet, if cross-platform support is a consideration."

"The plugin manager, available from a menu choice, allows you to download plugins from the
jEdit site. The user interface queries the Internet site, presents a list and explanations of the
plugins and will even download and install them for you. This is great."
