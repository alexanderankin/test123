<h2> By Matthieu Casanova </h2>

<p> RFCReader provides two fold handlers, and a hyperlink source. </p>

<h3> Fold handlers </h3>

<p>
When editing files in rfc edit mode, you can have folds that are aware of pages, or sections and subsections of the RFC documents. You can change the default fold handler for an edit mode from <tt>Global Options - Editing</tt> and select your mode, un-check "use default settings" and then select the desired fold mode. 
</p>

<p> Fold handlers, as always, can be used as Section headings in the SideKick structure browser, by using the Outline plugin. 
</p>

<h3> Hyperlinks </h3>

<p> The hyperlink plugin lets you click on links and open them as hyperlinks. You have to hold the CTRL button to see the link, and if it fits the pattern of the link, you can click on it to open.  RFCReader plugin provides a HyperLinkSource service that allows RFC references to be hyperlinked.
