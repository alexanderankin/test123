<h1>FileSync Plugin</h1>

<br/>
Synchronizes files in a project to another directory. This is a one-way sync,
from ProjectViewer to the other directory. So when you save, add, or delete
a file via ProjectViewer, the corresponding file in the other directory will
be updated, added, or deleted. This is particularly handy for web application
development, saving your file in jEdit can now automatically copy that file
to your web server. For remote servers, you can still use FileSync by mounting
a directory from the remote server to your local file system with webdav or
sshfs or smb, for example, then setting FileSync to save to the mount point.
<p>
Configuration is per project, so use the project properties to set which files
in your project get copied where.
<p>
NOTE: It is not required that a file actually belong to a project to be
included in a file sync. It just needs to be in a project directory.

<p>
File synchronization is enabled for the project by checking the "Enable file
sync" checkbox.
<p>
You can automatically exclude cvs, svn, and git directories by checking the
appropriate checkboxes.
<p>
You can add multiple directories to sync per project and define includes
and excludes for each directory.
<p>
For each directory:
<ul>
<li><strong>Source</strong> - This is a directory in your project.</li>
<li><strong>Include</strong> - This is a wildcard string that uses '?' and
'*' to represent a single or multiple (zero or more) wildcard characters.
This is the same glob pattern used by jEdit. The include string
check is case-sensitive on Unix and Unix-like systems (Linux and Mac) and is
case-insentive on Windows. Multiple include strings can be supplied at once
by using a comma to separate the strings.</li>
<li><strong>Exclude</strong> - This is a wildcard string that uses '?' and
'*' to represent a single or multiple (zero or more) wildcard characters.
This is the same glob pattern used by jEdit. The exclude string
check is case-sensitive on Unix and Unix-like systems (Linux and Mac) and is
case-insentive on Windows.</li>
<li><strong>Target</strong> - This is where to copy the included files.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The "Edit" button allows you to make changes to an existing sync definition.
<p>
The "Add" button allows to to create a new sync definition.
<p>
The "Remove" button will remove the sync definition and optionally remove all 
files from the target directory.
<p>

When first setting up a project for FileSync, you will probably want to do
a full synchronization to get all your project files to the destination. Use
the ProjectViewer context menu and select "FileSync - Sync All Files". You 
can use this action at any time to resync your files. This action actually
removes all files from your defined target directories, then uses your sync
definitions to repopulate those directories.
<p>
The glob wildcards used by this plugin are the same glob
patterns supported by jEdit, including using the (re) prefix to indicate the
glob is actually a regular expression. See the details in jEdit's help files, 
in particular, the section in Appendix D titled "Glob Patterns". One minor
difference is that file name matching is case-insensitive on Windows and
case-sensitive on all other operating systems.
<p>
Here are a few examples for include and exclude filters:
<br>
*.txt will match c.txt<br>
*.jpg will not match c.txt<br>
*.txt,*.jpg will match c.txt<br>
a/b/* will match a/b/c.txt<br>
a/*/c.txt will match a/b/c.txt<br>
*.??? will match c.txt<br>
*.???? will not match c.txt<br>
<br>
For example, to include all files except anything in a javadoc folder, you
could use:<br>
Include: *
Exclude: */javadoc*
<br>
<br>
Notice that it's */javadoc* and not */javadoc/*. Using the first form also
excludes the javadoc folder. Using the second form will cause the javadoc
folder to be copied, but the folder itself will be empty.
<br>
<br>
Here are a few more examples from jEdit's help file:
<br>
* will match all files.<br>
*.java will match all files whose names end with “.java”.<br>
*.[ch] will match all files whose names end with either “.c” or “.h”.<br>
*.{c,cpp,h,hpp,cxx,hxx} will match all C or C++ files.<br>
[^#]* will match all files whose names do not start with “#”.<br>
<br>
<br>
Here is an example of using the (re) prefix to indicate the glob pattern is
actually a regular expression:
<br>
(re).*\.(h|c(c|pp)?) will match *.c, *.cpp, *.h, *.cc

Inspiration for this plugin came from the FileSync plugin for Eclipse:

This not a port, I didn't use any code from the Eclipse FileSync plugin.
