To do:
- Bugs:
  - Expression tooltips not removed when debug session ends.
  - "null" value for empty strings in launch configuration.
    This includes incorrect "null" parameters on the command-line.
- BreakpointTable:
  - Call tableStructureChanged only if it really changed. Otherwise, call
    dataChanged instead. Set a boolean variable whenever a column is added to
    the column list to check for structure changes.
  - Provide 'go to source' by double clicking a breakpoint in the list.
    Use hard-coded column names for this function, for the file and line number.
  - Enabled column should use editable check boxes.
  - Breakpoint editor: Based on the columns and values from the table (model).
    Since each field (column) requires its own gdb command for setting, only
    enable editing of a hard-coded set of columns.
    (This should be good enough for all practical purposes, the structure of
     the table should be fixed.)
- Fix breakpoint UI to reflect GDB state rather than plugin actions.
  Two sets of breakpoints need to be maintained:
  - Offline list: Simple list of source locations with their "offline" properties
    (skip count, enabled, ...) to be used when gdb starts running. No need to keep
    gdb state in this list (E.g. breakpoint numbers).
  - Online list: List of real gdb breakpoints, available only after gdb starts
    running. This list does not necessarily have to be maintained in the plugin, as
    it is maintained by gdb and retrieved from gdb anyway. We can table the bp number
    from gdb (from the table).
  Use a single text painter extension, provide different icons for offline list and
  online list. The extension should check, if the breakpoint is only offline it
  should mark this with a different icon. If the breakpoint is also online, it means
  that gdb has accepted it and forget about the offline entry.
  The table should list both, maybe enabling a filter to hide offline ones when gdb
  is running.
- Extend type->macro map to allow 'set', not only 'get'.
--> Locals/Watches/Variables:
  - Support changes in tree structure of variable.
  - Provide an action and a context menu item to change the currently selected
    variable (leafs only).
- Watches:
  - Provide actions and context menu items for:
    - Add an item to the tree.
    - Remove an item from the tree.
    - Modify an item in the tree.

Future:
- Variables:
  - Format specificiation (e.g. hexa/decimal/octal/binary)
  - Editing watches (e.g. just change index of array element in watch expression)
  - Casting
- Launch configurations:
  - Support for core files
  - Support for attaching to processes
- Multi-threading support, including views, stack trace etc.
- Memory/Disassembly/Registers view.
- Symbol query commands.

Done:
+ Launch configurations:
  + Move to debugger-specific extension
  + Improved GUI for the launch configurations (e.g. file dialogs)
+ Breakpoint window:
  + Move to debugger-specific extension
  + Skip count
  + Conditions
  + Watch points
+ Program output view:
  + Add program stderr. (at first, merged with stdout)
  + Allow clearing of contents.
  + Clear automatically whenever session begins.
+ Complete gdb command-set (e.g. exec-until).
+ Write a short user guide.
+ gdb output console:
  + Send all gdb output there.
  + Allow entering commands manually.
+ Bug Fix: Must also wait for "^done" in CLI commands. Otherwise this "^done" might
  be captured by the handler of the next MI command. 
+ Refactoring:
  + New GdbState singleton.
  + New GdbView base for views, registers for gdb state changes, invokes update()
    and sessionEnded() when appropriate.
  + Handle manual changes in vars.
  + Handle changes of current frame.
+ A view that is opened in the middle of a debug session should update itself
  automatically upon opening.
+ Handle end of session in parser and possibly command manager: parser thread
  should stop.
+ Locals/Watches/Variables: Add toolbar button for modifying the selected var value.
+ Control panel: Should be aware of the gdb state, enable/disable buttons.
+ Tooltips for variables under caret in the buffer.
+ Fix bug: After responding to Stop button in Console, the Console is not aware
  that the operation finished and the animation goes on; Call Output.commandDone().
+ Add option to specify format for display of various types
  (e.g. display Qt4 strings as const char *). Add mapping from type to gdb macro name.
  Gdb macros will be defined in .gdbinit, and GdbPlugin will run them (with the
  expression to evaluate as input) and display the output of the macro as value.
+ Add type inference rules for the type->macro map.
