<h1>Gdb plugin</h1>
Written by Shlomy Reinstein, 4/2007.
<h2>Introduction</h2>
This plugin enables debugging programs using the gdb debugger directly from
jEdit. The plugin provides the following functionality:
<ul>
<li>
Setting/Removing/Toggling breakpoints directly in jEdit buffers.
</li>
<li>
Controlling program execution (the usual continue/step/next/...) - either
using actions from the GdbPlugin menu or using a very simple control panel.
</li>
<li>
Visualization of breakpoints and the current instruction using icons in the
gutter area.
</li>
<li>
Viewing/changing values of expressions and automatic variables (function
arguments and variables defined inside the function).
</li>
<li>
Breakpoint dockable which enables editing breakpoint properties (conditions/
skip counts/enabled state) and adding watchpoints.
</li>
<li>
Stack trace (normally called "backtrace" in gdb) dockable that enables you
to view and quickly jump to the source code of selected stack frames.
</li>
<li>
Defining "launch configurations" - i.e. the applications to debug, their
command-line arguments etc.
</li>
<li>
A console for viewing program output and the gdb output.
</li>
</ul>

The plugin uses gdb/mi (for most functions) to interface with gdb. This is a
very incomplete and premature version provided only for preview, it is missing
many features and might be quite unstable. Use at your own risk! 
Despite the above, I found it to be quite helpful in debugging my applications.

<h2>Usage</h2>
First thing's first: If you don't have 'gdb' in your PATH, you should define
the path to gdb using: Plugins->Plugin Options->GdbPlugin->Gdb.
<p>
Next, you need to define how to launch your application under gdb. For this, you
create a launch configuration using:
Plugins->Plugin Options->GdbPlugin->Programs.
Click the 'New' button below the "Configurations" box and enter all the details.
'Name' is a symbolic name you assign to the configuration, which simply shows
in the "Configurations" list. In 'Environment' you can set a series of
environment variables for the debug session in the form
var1=value1,var2=value2,...
<p>
When you're done filling in the details, click the 'Update' button below them.
<br>
The 'Make default' button below the "Configurations" box marks the selected
configuration with an asterisk, which means it is now the default configuration,
and will be used to launch the next debug session. If the configuration you've
just added is not marked with an asterisk, select it in the "Configurations" box
and click 'Make default'.
<p>
* Note: Some paragraphs will direct you to open dockables. To open a dockable,
  use Utilities->Global Options->jEdit->Docking then select the appropriate
  dockable from the list and change its docking from 'floating' to something
  else and click Ok.
<p>  
By now, you've set up the gdb path and the launch configuration for debugging.
Now, you can start debugging.
<br>
You can do the following:
<ol>
<li>
Mark breakpoints in jEdit buffers by putting the caret on the breakpoint line
and invoking 'Set breakpoint' from the GdbPlugin plugin menu.
</li>
<li>
Control the debugger (go!, step, next, quit, pause, ...) using either actions
from the GdbPlugin plugin menu or using the dockable named 'Control Panel'.
</li>
<li>
See the stack trace whenever gdb stops (e.g. in a breakpoint) using the
dockable named 'Stack Trace'. When a stack trace is available, you can jump
between the frames by clicking on them.
</li>
<li>
See the automatic variables (arguments + local variables) using the dockable
named 'Local Variables'.
</li>
<li>
Watch the value of custom variables and expressions using the dockable named
'Watches'.
<br>
* The "Variables" dockable provides both (4) and (5) in a split pane, for those
  who prefer to see both in the same docking area.
</li>
<li>
Edit breakpoints/add watchpoints using the dockable named "Breakpoints".
</li>
<li>
Watch the program output using the dockable named "Program Output".
</li>
</ol>

Tips:
It is recommended to create keyboard shortcuts or toolbar buttons for quick
access to frequent debugging actions. Also, you can use the beta-version of the
"Perspective" plugin (which has been merged into the "Docker" plugin in SVN but
not released yet) to easily switch between the usual (development) layout and
the debugging layout of dockables easily, so you won't have to use the Utilities
menu each time to open the debugger dockables.
