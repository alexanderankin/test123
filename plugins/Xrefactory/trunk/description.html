It provides code completion, source browser (find definiton, find all usages, find unused symbols) class tree viewer, symbol retriever and a refactoring browser. Refactorings allow method extraction, safe symbol renaming, adding/removing/reordering of parameters, moving of fields and methods among classes, moving of classes among packages, etc. Refactorings are safe with detection of possible conflicts.
