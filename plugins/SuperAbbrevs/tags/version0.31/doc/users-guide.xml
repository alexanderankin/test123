      This plugin gives you the ability to expand an abbreviations to userdefined
      code template. When expanded you can jump between the variables in the
      template using the TAB key. If you change the text of a variable, the text
      will change everywhere the variable is placed in the template.
    </para>
    <para>
      There is already some predefined abbreviations when you install the plugin, 
      you can find them in the <application>SuperAbbrevs</application>
      optionpane. Each mode have a list of defined abbreviations, you can change
      between the mode in the dropdown menu at the top of the optionpane, an the
      abbreviations associated with the mode will be shown in the table below.
      There is a special mode added, <emphasis>global</emphasis>, that defines
      abbreviations that works across all modes. 
    </para>
    <para>
    	You can defined, edit or delete the abbreviations from the optionpane,
      this will be explained further in <xref linkend="Using the plugin"/>.

  <chapter id="Writing templates"><title>Writing templates</title>

    <para>
      A template can consist of the following things:
    </para>  
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>Variable
        <para>
          Variables is the essential part of a template, you write a variable
          in a template as ${number:value} where number is the TAB index of the 
          variable, and value is the text that will be inserted in the
          variable when the template is expanded. The value will be inserted
          instead of the variable when the template is expanded.
        </para>
        <para>
        	The characters \ { } have to be escaped in the value as \\ \{ \}.
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>Variable reference
        <para>
          You can refere to a variable by inserting $number, where number is
          the TAB index of the variable you are referring to. This inserts the
          text of the variable instead of the reference.
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>Transformation variable reference
        <para>
          This is a special kind of reference where you can run beanshell code
          on the text of the referred variable. You insert it in the template
          as ${number=code} where number is the TAB index of the variable you
          are referring to, and code is arbitrary beanshell code. In the code
          the beanshell variable <emphasis>s</emphasis> holds the text of the
          referred variable. The functions in the file 
          <emphasis>.jedit/SuperAbbrevs/abbrevs_functions.bsh</emphasis> is also available in the
          code.
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>The end variable
        <para>
          A special variable is $end, this variable will always be defined for a
          template, and represents the last place the cursor will jump to in the
          template. If the $end variable is not explicit defined, it will be
          inserted at the end of the template. When you type in the end variable
          the template becomes inactive and the TAB key functions as normal.
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>Normal text
        <para>
          Everywhere thing else is just normal text that's inserted and not
          manipulated by the template engine. 
        </para>
        <para>
          One thing to be aware of is that there is some character sequences that 
          have to be escaped.
        	If you want to write $ in the text you have to escape it as \$. As well
          \ should be escapes as \\.
        </para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>
    	This example shows you how to make a java field with getter and setters.
      The firstUp function makes the first character of the variable uppercase.
    </para>
    <para>
      <programlisting><![CDATA[
private ${2:Type} ${1:field};

/**
 * Getter function for the field $1
 */ 
public $2 get${1=firstUp(s)}() {
	return $1;
}

/**
 * Setter function for the field $1
 */
public void set${1=firstUp(s)}($2 $1){
	this.$1 = $1;
}
]]></programlisting>
    </para>
    <para>
    	The best advice I can give you is to look at the already defined,
      templates and play around with them.
    </para>
  </chapter>
  <chapter id="Template generation"><title>Template generation</title>
    <para>
    	This is only for advanced users.
    </para>
    <para>
    	It's possible to generate a template with beanshell code, 
      you embed code into the template in between &lt;# code #&gt;, the template 
      is then turned inside out, so all the normal text is turn into print 
      statements, and the code will be executed. It's possible to print new code
      to the template with &lt;#= code #&gt; where the code have to evaluate to
      a string. All the functions in the files 
      <emphasis>.jedit/SuperAbbrevs/template_generation_functions.bsh</emphasis>
      <emphasis>.jedit/SuperAbbrevs/abbrevs_functions.bsh</emphasis> is
      available, as well as a variable <emphasis>selection</emphasis>, holding
      the selection.
    </para>
    <para>
    	This example shows how to generate a HTML multiplying table of 5 rows and
      5 columns, not that usefull but only imagination hold you back.
    </para>
    <para>
      <programlisting><![CDATA[
<table>
<# for(i=0; i<=5; i++){ #>
  <tr>
  <# for(j=0; j<=5; j++){ #>
    <td><#= i*j #></td>
  <# } #>
  </tr>
<# } #>
</table>
