Things I've like to implement in the next version
-------------------------------------------------
* import normal jedit abbrevs - should not overwrite 
  existing superabbrevs. DONE ;-)

* Make help alot better - Remember to introduce the 
  optionpane in the help.

* Maybe select the instance where the variables default 
  value is defined, instead of selecting the first occurence. 
  DONE.
  
* Make a option tab where you can define variables to use in the templates,
  lige author and stuff.
  
* Make a transformation field like: ${2=firstUp(s)} where you can use arbitrarily
  bean shell code. This should not be that hard with the new template engine.
  DONE
  
* Make Shift-Tab define/edit a template if you are at the end of a word.
  Error!!! 

* Make a action to open the abbrevs_functions.bsh file and
  template_generation_functions.bsh file.
