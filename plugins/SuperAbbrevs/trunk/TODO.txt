Things I've like to implement in the next version
-------------------------------------------------
* import normal jedit abbrevs - should not overwrite 
  existing superabbrevs. DONE ;-)

* Make help alot better - Remember to introduce the 
  optionpane in the help.

* Maybe select the instance where the variables default 
  value is defined, instead of selecting the first occurence. 
  DONE.
  
* Make a option tab where you can define variables to use in the templates,
  lige author and stuff.
  
* Make a transformation field like: ${2=firstUp(s)} where you can use arbitrarily
  bean shell code. This should not be that hard with the new template engine.
  Maybe there should be a option tab for defining global function for use in the 
  templates, and a advanced panel to defined functions for a template.
  A usefull global function would be, choose(string,regex,value1,value2), 
  that chooses the value1 if the regex matches the string, else value2.
  
I've would very much like the function editor to be JEditTextArea in 
bean shell mode. It could also be rater nice to use the JEditTextArea for the 
abbrevsEditor, and make a mode for it. This will make it posible to have 
highlighting, SuperAbbrevs :-)
