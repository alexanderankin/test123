Things I've like to implement in the next version
-------------------------------------------------
* import normal jedit abbrevs - should not overwrite 
  existing superabbrevs. 

* Make help alot better - Remember to introduce the 
  optionpane in the help.

* Maybe select the instance where the variables default 
  value is defined instead of selecting the first occurence.
