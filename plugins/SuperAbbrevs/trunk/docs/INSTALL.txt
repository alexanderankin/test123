To install the plugin you need to set the correct properties 
for the platform you are compiling on. 

Define the following variables in the build.properties file:

jedit.install.dir: A path containing the jEdit.jar file 
install.dir: The path to the jars folder in the jedit settings directory 
docbook.xsl: The DocBook xsl installation
stylesheet: The stylesheet used to generate the documentation

Lastly you have to run ant to compile and install the files.
