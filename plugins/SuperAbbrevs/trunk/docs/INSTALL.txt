This plugin uses the standard build script from the build-support project.

The only thing you need to do is to se the property jedit.install.dir to point 
to the jedit installation directory and set the install.dir to point to the 
location where the jars file should be installed. You can set these variables in 
one of the following files: build.properties or ../build.properties.
