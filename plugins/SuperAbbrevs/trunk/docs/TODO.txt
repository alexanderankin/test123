Things I've like to implement
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* import normal jedit abbrevs - should not overwrite 
  existing superabbrevs. 
  DONE

* Maybe select the instance where the variables default 
  value is defined, instead of selecting the first occurence. 
  DONE.
  
* Make a transformation field like: ${2=firstUp(s)} where you can use arbitrarily
  bean shell code. This should not be that hard with the new template engine.
  DONE

* Escape selection properly in templatee generation, men the indentation work 
  correct. 
  DONE
  
* Make a option tab where you can define variables to use in the templates,
  like author and stuff.
  DONE
  
* BUG: You can't put $end in front of text, like $endname.
  DONE
  
* Make Shift-Tab define/edit a template if you are at the end of a word.
  Load the abbreviation if its defined
  DONE

* Bug: If you try to define a new abbreviation by pressing shift-tab, and there 
  are no abbreviations defined for the mode already, you will get a null 
  pointer exception.
  DONE

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Make help alot better - Remember to introduce the 
  optionpane in the help
  
* Make a action to open the abbrevs_functions.bsh file and
  template_generation_functions.bsh file.
  
* Errorhandling when generating templates with errors

* Print out abbrevs in a buffer, both for a mode and all the mode.
  For this to make sense each abbrev should have a description.
  
* Make a pane for importing and exporting abbrevs, introduce a description field 
  to each abbrev.

* Merge default abbrevs with already defined abbrevs in the 
  install process.
  
* Abbrevs and user variable names has to be a valid identifier.

* The change abbrevs editor only shows the mode specific abbrevaition, if it is
  not defined then show the global abbrevaition.
