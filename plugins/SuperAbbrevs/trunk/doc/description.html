<p> This plugin enables you to <i>tab</i>-expand an abbreviation with variables
in it. After the abbreviation is expanded, you can use the <i>tab</i>-key to
jump between the variables. If you change the content of a variable in the
abbreviation, all the variables with the same name will change accordingly. It
is also possible to make variables that changes their content depending on the
content of another variable. The user can define his own abbreviation for each
mode supported by jEdit in the SuperAbbrevs option-pane.
