        <p>This plugin provides the NimROD Look and Feel to jEdit. Note that the NimROD jar
        file included with this plugin has been slightly modified to accommodate the 48 bit
        colors provided by jEdit's color chooser.</p>

        <p>
        <b>All configuration for this plugin is done in the Look and Feel
        plugin.</b>
        <br/>
        Go to Plugins - Plugin Options - Look And Feel, then select "NimROD" 
        from the Look and Feel dropdown. You will have the option to configure 
        a theme by clicking the 'NimROD Theme Editor' button.
        </p>
        <p>
        The configuration dialog has three tabs, "Basic", "Advanced", and "Themes". 
        </p>
        </p>In the
        Basic tab, you can set two colors, and all remaining colors will be automatically
        calculated to fit nicely with those colors. You can save a theme by clicking the "Save" button.
        You can save the theme either as a update to the current theme or save it with a new name.
        Note that just clicking the "Ok" will apply the changes, but they won't be saved in the "Themes" list.
        
        </p>
        <p>
        In the Advanced tab, you can set all colors individually, plus you can set
        values for Black (mostly used for text color), White (mostly used for text
        field backgrounds), and opacity for frame borders and menus.  You can save a theme by clicking the "Save" button.
        You can save the theme either as a update to the current theme or save it with a new name.
        Note that just clicking the "Ok" will apply the changes, but they won't be saved in the "Themes" list.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        In the Themes tab, you can select existing themes to use. There are 6 pre-defined themes:
        <ul>
         <li>Bluebird, a bluish theme</li>
         <li>Canary, a yellowish theme</li>
         <li>Flamingo, a pinkish theme</li>
         <li>Osterich, a dark, brownish theme</li>
         <li>Parrot, a greenish theme</li>
         <li>Raven, a dark theme</li>
         <li>Redwing, a dark theme with redish highlights</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        
        <h3 id="about" style="background:#7FB2FF">About</h3>
        <p>NimROD Look and Feel was developed by Nilo J. Gonz√°lez.</p>
        <p>The home page for NimROD is at <a href="http://nilogonzalez.es/nimrodlf/index.html">http://nilogonzalez.es/nimrodlf/index.html</a></p>
        <p>NimROD Look and Feel is a customizable extension of Swing's Metal Look and Feel.</p>
        <p>NimROD has been modified slightly from the latest release version to accommodate jEdit color chooser providing 48 bit colors. It should still
        work as expected if used outside of jEdit.</p>
