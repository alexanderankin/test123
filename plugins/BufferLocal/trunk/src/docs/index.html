Swiped directly from the jEdit 4.2 documentation, with emphasis added:
<p>
<table border="1" bgcolor="lightgray">
<tr><td>
Buffer-local properties provide an alternate way to change editor settings on a 
per-buffer basis. <b><i>While changes made in the Buffer Options dialog box are lost 
after the buffer is closed,</i></b> buffer-local properties take effect each time the 
file is opened, because they are embedded in the file itself.
<p>
When jEdit loads a file, it checks the first and last 10 lines for colon-enclosed 
name/value pairs. For example, placing the following in a buffer changes the 
indent width to 4 characters, enables soft tabs, and activates the Perl edit mode:
<p>
:indentSize=4:noTabs=true:mode=perl:
<p>
Adding buffer-local properties to a buffer takes effect after the next time the 
buffer is saved.
</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
Unfortunately, there isn't a nice gui to create the buffer-local line, and some
coding standards prohibit putting such editor/ide specific lines directly into
the source code.
<p>
To get around this, the BufferLocal plugin stores the settings made using the
Buffer Options dialog box and applies those settings to each file as they are
opened.
<p>
There is no set up or configuration for this plugin, once installed, it is active.
Use the Buffer Option dialog to adjust the settings for a file, and those settings
will automatically be saved and applied to the file the next time it is opened.
