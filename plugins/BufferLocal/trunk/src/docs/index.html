<p>
The BufferLocal Plugin saves the settings made using the Buffer Options dialog
and restores those settings the next time the file is opened. This means that
you don't have to manually change the settings each time the file is opened. The
motivation for this comes from jEdit itself... </p>
<p> The file that is used to store bufferlocal properties is in your jEdit settings directory,
and named <tt>.bufferlocalplugin.cfg</tt>. </p>
<p>
Swiped directly from the jEdit 4.2 documentation, with emphasis added:
<p>
<table border="1" bgcolor="lightgray">

Buffer-local properties provide an alternate way to change editor settings on a
per-buffer basis. <b><i>While changes made in the Buffer Options dialog box are lost
after the buffer is closed,</i></b> buffer-local properties take effect each time the
file is opened, because they are embedded in the file itself.
<p>
When jEdit loads a file, it checks the first and last 10 lines for colon-enclosed
name/value pairs. For example, placing the following in a buffer changes the
indent width to 4 characters, enables soft tabs, and activates the Perl edit mode:
<p>
:indentSize=4:noTabs=true:mode=perl:
<p>
Adding buffer-local properties to a buffer takes effect after the next time the
buffer is saved.
</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
Unfortunately, there isn't a nice gui to create the buffer-local line, and some
coding standards prohibit putting such editor/ide specific lines directly into
the source code.
<p>
To get around this, the BufferLocal plugin stores the settings made using the
Buffer Options dialog box and applies those settings to each file as they are
opened.
<p>
There is no set up or configuration required for this plugin, once installed, it is active.
Use the Buffer Option dialog to adjust the settings for a file, and those settings
will automatically be saved and applied to the file the next time it is opened.
<p>
Version 1.2:
<p>
Originally, BufferLocal was called "BufferMinder" and closed buffers that were open
for a while but not used. I'll refer to these buffers as "stale".
Closing stale buffers helps reduce clutter without any work. This feature
never made it into the initial release, but others have requested it, so it's back now.
It is off by default, use the Plugin Options to turn it on and to adjust
how long a file should be unused before it is closed. Files that need saved will
not be closed, you'll need to save first.
<p>
To turn on automatic buffer closing, click 'Plugins' then 'Plugin Options'.
Select 'BufferLocal' from the tree on the left side. Check the box that says
'Close files not used'. Set the time limit with the spinner.  Check the box
'while window is active' to have the timer run only when the jEdit window is
active.  This means you can open a file, minimize jEdit for a couple of hours
and you files will still be there when you come back and the timer will pick
up where it left off.
<p>
When the 'Close files not used' box is unchecked, BufferLocal will still
keep track of stale buffers. You can close stale buffers at any time by
clicking 'Plugins', then 'BufferLocal', then 'Close Stale Buffers'.
