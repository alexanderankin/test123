<h1>SyntaxHelper documentation</h1>
Written by Shlomy Reinstein, September 2007.
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>SyntaxHelper makes it easy to configure syntax highlighting styles in jEdit by
providing the Syntax Highlighting option pane as a dockable window, that:
<ul>
<li> Provides immediate feedback in the buffer when a syntax style is changed
<li> Enables cancellation of changes to syntax styles
<li> Makes it easy to configure the style of desired text by highlighting the style
of the text under the caret.
</ul>
<h2>Usage</h2>
Show the Syntax Highlighting dockable window using the SyntaxHelper menu. In the
dockable window, you can:
<ul>
<li>Change a syntax style by clicking its row in the table. Changes are immediately
reflected in the buffer.
<li>Apply (commit) all the changes you've made so far by clicking the Apply button.
<li>Cancel all the changes you've made by clicking the Cancel button.
<li>Find which style is used for a desired text fragment by setting the
"Mark row of current token" check-box and then moving the caret to the desired fragment.
</ul>
<h3>Enjoy!</h3>
