<p>SyntaxHelper makes it easy to configure syntax highlighting styles in jEdit by
providing the Syntax Highlighting option pane as a dockable window, that:
<ul>
<li> Provides immediate feedback in the buffer when a syntax style is changed
<li> Enables cancellation of changes to syntax styles
<li> Makes it easy to configure the style of desired text by highlighting the style
of the text under the caret.
</ul>
