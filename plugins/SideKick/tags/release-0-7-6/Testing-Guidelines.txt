When making changes to SideKick, especially its event handling code, we need to test its ability to parse in response to the correct events.

Test with 2 views, each with a docked SideKick displayed, parsing a different buffer.

Next test that SideKick parses in response to these events:
    switch parsers in the parser combo
    save the buffer (if parse on save is checked)
    change to another buffer (if parse on switch is checked)
    change the edit mode 
 
    
It should only parse the Active view, and not the other View's sidekick.

When the SideKick combo is switched, the proper SideKick should be used. 
When "reparse" is selected, the same parser should be used again.
