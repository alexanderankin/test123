The SideKick plugin describes a framework for structure browsing and completion. 
It defines a single dockable window which can be used to show a tree structure of the
current buffer. It also defines a specification for how plugins can provide language-specific completion popups.
In addition, it can show the structure in a toolbar, using one or more combo-boxes.
