- select content of asset
- parent/child asset actions
- should not reparse on edit pane change
- tree: custom actions on double-click, etc.
- auxilliary parsers -- eg tasklist
- position: don't obscure text area
- parse keys toggle
- when going to an element, instead of going to start, have a 'preferred caret pos' thing
- save/switch separated parse
- after loading a parser, have to re-parse buffer

- have a standard parser if none is registered (using intentation or folding)
- parser delegation for mixed content (like in mode rules)?
