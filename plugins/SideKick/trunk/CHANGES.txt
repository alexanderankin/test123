        MarkerSets 0.8 (Optional)
        Sidekick unable to clear checkbox tree/combo follows caret (#3445893 -
        Shlomy)
        Integration with Markersets (#3392131 - shlomy).
        Default Focus on Tree, not filter field. (#3405334 - ezust).
        Fixed sidekick unload problem (Matthieu Casanova)
        Fixed memory leak (Matthieu Casanova)
        Allow Look and Feel changes at runtime.
        Fix completion popup regarding macro recorder (3175336 - Eric Le Lay).
    Version 1.1
        Added options for showing the structure of the buffer in a toolbar
        (using combo-boxes), for cases where the tree takes too much screen
        space.
    Version 1.0
        New macros / actions: search asset for selection and go to begin/end of
        function.
        Added a "macros/" dir where additional bsh macros can be placed.
        Fixes for 'go to next' and 'go to previous' asset, which also fixes
        Tracker 3008037.
        Fix for Shift-Click on sidekick tree to select the entire asset.
        Fix for Tracker 3081956, race condition during parse on save.
    Version 0.9
        Added ability for SideKick derivatives to specify an initial tree
        expansion model. This model can be based on option settings or specific
        language characteristics. For example, the JavaSideKick could expand
        inner classes to show method names while leaving the imports node
        collapsed.
        Added ability to hide and disable the filter text area. Some users don't
        use it and it tends to grab focus away from the tree, so this new
        feature helps those users.
        Added alternate keyboard handling to the tree. Now using the arrow keys
        causes movement through the tree to work as a normal tree and all nodes
        are accessible with the arrow keys. Nodes are not automatically expanded
        as they are highlighted. The previous keyboard handling is accessible by
        using the Ctrl key with the up and down arrows, this will move the tree
        selection to the next/prev leaf nodes, which some people find useful
        when used in conjunction with the filter text box.
    Version 0.8 requires JDK 1.5, jEdit 4.3pre17 and ErrorListPlugin 1.4.
        Fixed issue where 'Select asset at caret' was not select the last
        character of the asset.

    Version 0.7.7 requires JDK 1.5, jEdit 4.3pre14 and ErrorListPlugin 1.4.
        Updated to 4.3pre17 API (using Iterator instead of Enumerator)
        Fixed "parse on save" so parsing does not occur when parse on save is
        not selected. (danson)
        Possible fix for 1633393, "TextArea painting corruption when saving".
        (danson)
        Fixed the auto-expand tree functionality that I broke earlier when
        adjusting it for the new filtering. (danson)
        Rearranged SideKick toolbars in dockable to add a text field for the
        "Filter" and a "clear" button to remove the current filter. Typing works
        as it did previously, that is, you don't have to click into the text
        field to begin entering a filter. (danson)
        Applied patch from bug#2134884 to resolve focus issues with filter
        textfield (Matthew Gilbert).
    Version 0.7.6 requires JDK 1.5, jEdit 4.3pre14 and ErrorListPlugin 1.4.
        Filtering capability in tree view (Matthew Gilbert, #1902558)
        Fixed a minor bug; typing over an active completion popup inactivated
        the popup. (Kazutoshi Satoda)
        Completion popup for explicit completion is now active as same as
        builtin completion. (Kazutoshi Satoda)
        Added a new option, which makes automatic completion popups get focus,
        to make the new behavior in 0.7.5 optional. (Kazutoshi Satoda, Bug
        #2027704)
        Fixed a memory leak; multiple parser specific panels could be held in
        SideKickTree. (Kazutoshi Satoda)

    Version 0.7.5 requires JDK 1.5, jEdit 4.3pre11 and ErrorListPlugin 1.4.
        Uses refactored CompletionPopup class in 4.3pre11. Checks the edit mode
        at the caret position for valid completions. When multiple completions
        are possible, Sidekick no longer selects the first item automatically
        when a space is typed. (1752044 - Kazutoshi Satoda).
        Fixed "sidekick fold starts in the previous line when the corresponding
        folding node starts at the beginning of the line ( 1767390 - Matthieu
        Casanova )
        Fixed a minor memory leak when Sidekick is unloaded ( Matthieu Casanova )
        Improved Mode Option Pane so it works properly when the edit mode is
        changed before an "ok/apply" (Shlomy Reinstein)

    Version 0.7.4 requires JDK 1.5, jEdit 4.3pre8 and ErrorListPlugin 1.4.
        Fixed "can't determine mode of buffer" ( 1744627 - Shlomy Reinstein )
        Added support for SideKick Parser Services to offer a JPanel for
        inserting above the SideKickTree. (Shlomy Reinstein, # 1744797 )
        Preserve horizontal scroll position (Vladimir Avondin # 1746146)

    Version 0.7.3 requires JDK 1.5, jEdit 4.3pre8 and ErrorListPlugin 1.4.
        Added parser setting from mode options pane. (ezust)
        NPE after install from plugin manager fixed. (Matthieu Casanova)
        Bug 1643614 fixed (reparse on mode change)

    Version 0.7.2 requires JDK 1.5, jEdit 4.3pre8 and ErrorListPlugin 1.4.
        Bugs 1617620,1624552 - Can't get rid of wrong parser. (hertzhaft, ezust)
        NPE fixed when a jEdit mode had no parser. (Matthieu Casanova)
        Added a dynamic parser switcher menu to a new ActionSet, allowing you to
        switch parsers via keyboard shortcuts. (ezust)
        Rewrote and simplified fold handler code (Matthieu Casanova).

    Version 0.7.1 requires JDK 1.5, jEdit 4.3pre8 and ErrorListPlugin 1.4.
        SF.net bugs 1072043, 1553554, 1506964 - Sidekick FoldHandler bugs fixed.
        SF.net bug # 1593604 - reparse on save happens only in the active view.
        Sf.net bug # 1595835 - can't switch to default parser

    Version 0.7 requires JDK 1.5, jEdit 4.3pre8 and ErrorListPlugin 1.4.
        Added a mode-specific option pane, so that settings can be customized on
        a mode basis by SideKick and its parser service plugins. (ezust).
        Made the completion popup accept-characters configurable. Prevented the
        completion popup from showing when the word at the caret is the same as
        a completion list entry. (hertzhaft)
        Recuses into non-asset nodes #1571697, 1573034. (shlomy)

    Version 0.6.6 requires JDK 1.5, jEdit 4.3pre5 and ErrorListPlugin 1.4.
        Added sidekick.util package. This contains classes to help integrate
        javacc-generated parsers with sidekick. (danson)
        Some work on the popup for code completion. It still doesn't work right
        with picking from the list with a mouse. (danson)
        Fix for a null pointer exception. (danson)

    Version 0.6.4 requires JDK 1.5, jEdit 4.3pre5 and ErrorListPlugin 1.4.
        Emits new EBMessage msg.CaretChanging when an asset is selected in the
        tree. (ezust)
        Mouse Clicks, PgUp and PgDn keys work from completion popups. Arrow keys
        don't wrap around anymore. (ezust)
        Popup menu on parse button for conveniently changing auto parse
        settings/caret follow settings (requires JDK 1.5). (ezust)
        Parse event bugfixes (ezust)

    Version 0.6.2 requires JDK 1.4, jEdit 4.3pre3 and ErrorListPlugin 1.4.
        Broke up options "parse on buffer switch/save" into 2 separate options.
        Now you can parse on switch, or on save, or on both, and when you switch
        buffers with parse-on-switch off, the tree keeps its state. (Alan Ezust)

        Added option setting to turn off tool tips. Tool tips can be annoying on
        slower systems as they are not necessarily drawn quickly. (Dale Anson)
        Added option setting to be able to display a status window at the bottom
        of the tree. This window is larger than the jEdit status bar, so the
        full display of tree node can be shown. This is nice when tool tips are
        off and the node details are shown on more than one line. (Dale Anson)

    Version 0.6.1 requires jEdit 4.3pre3 and ErrorListPlugin 1.4.
        Made SideKickParser.name protected.
        Bug 1504746 fixed [combobox].

    Version 0.6 requires jEdit 4.3pre3 and ErrorListPlugin 1.4.
        Added a combo box to let you switch parsers on an individual buffer
        basis. (Alan Ezust)
        Improved Documentation. (Alan Ezust)
        No more multi-line StatusBar messages. Using getShortString() instead of
        getLongString(). (Alan Ezust)

    Version 0.5 requires jEdit 4.3pre3 and ErrorListPlugin 1.2.
        SideKick now auto-expands the proper depth of the tree, and properly
        follows the textarea's caret as the selected node in the sidekick. (Dale
        Anson)
        A new context menu exists in SideKick permitting the user to set and
        view markers. (Martin Raspe)

    Version 0.4 requires jEdit 4.3pre3 and ErrorListPlugin 1.2.
        Moved 4 classes from the PerlSideKick plugin into this plugin. The
        classes are in package sidekick.enhanced. This is so that we can break
        the dependency between JavaScriptSideKick and PerlSideKick.
        Patched for 4.3pre3 API

    Version 0.3.4 requires jEdit 4.2final.
        Added a new IAsset interface that can be used instead of the Asset
        abstract class to realize more flexible inheritance relationships.
        Added a new option pane to associate edit modes with SideKick parsers.

    Version 0.3.3 requires jEdit 4.2final.
        The completion popup is now positioned within the screen bounds.
        The SideKickCompletion class is now much more full-featured (but
        backwards-compatible, if you ignore the new features).
        Some changes were made to the way the parser works to improve perceived
        responsiveness.
        The SideKickParsedData associated with a buffer was not unset when the
        SideKick plugin was unloaded, and as a result, reloading the SideKick
        plugin would horribly break buffers using the "sidekick" fold handler.

        The option to delay parsing after a keystroke did not work; the timeout
        was always fixed at 1.5 seconds.

    Version 0.3.2 requires jEdit 4.2final and ErrorListPlugin 1.2.
        Fixed NullPointerException in Select Asset.
        Sometimes a buffer would be parsed more than once in a row.
        Fixed a bug that would show the completion popup twice if the Show
        completion popups where possible option was on andthe popup trigger
        delay was larger than 0 seconds and the user invoked the complete action
        before the trigger delay run out. (Dirk Moebius)
        Fixed a bug where typing with the completion popup open would not insert
        keys if there were no completions available.

    Version 0.3.1 requires jEdit 4.2pre3 and ErrorListPlugin 1.2.
        SideKickCompletion implementations can now disable automatic completion
        popups.
        Fix a problem in buffer listener handling.
        Various other minor fixes.

    Version 0.3 requires jEdit 4.2pre3 and ErrorListPlugin 1.1.
        Updated for jEdit 4.2 API changes.
        Added getParseTriggers() method to SideKickParser class.
        Added getErrorSource() method to SideKickPlugin class.
        Cleaned up and debugged completion code.
        Previously if the parse on keystroke option was on, an in-progress parse
        was not stopped. This resulted in poor performance. Now, an API has been
        added for stopping parsing (although only the XML plugin uses it at the
        moment). Combined with the position optimization in jEdit 4.2pre3, this
        should result in improved responsiveness when editing large XML files.


    Version 0.2 requires jEdit 4.1pre11 and ErrorListPlugin 1.0.
        Fixed a thread safety problem.
        Added activate() and deactivate() methods to SideKickParser class. These
        methods are called when a buffer using this parser is selected and
        deselected in a given view.
        The priority of the thread used by SideKick to parse files is now the
        minimum priority.
        jEdit keyboard shortcuts now work when invoked while a completion popup
        is open.

    Version 0.1 requires jEdit 4.1pre11.
        Initial release.
