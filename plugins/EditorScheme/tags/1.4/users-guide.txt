Summary
=======

EditorScheme lets one easily switch between predefined color & style
combinations for jEdit's TextArea and a number of jEdit's Plugins.

EditorScheme support setting colors & styles for the following
plugins:

* Console Plugin
* ErrorList Plugin
* JDiff Plugin
* TaskList Plugin
* WhiteSpace Plugin

Usage
=====

EditorScheme lets you can create new schemes, switch between
existing schemes, and update existing schemes.

Creating Schemes
----------------

To create a new scheme, select  `Plugins` ->
`Editor Scheme Selector`. Press  `New`  to create a scheme based
on the current settings. The scheme file will be saved in the
schemes directory in your jEdit settings directory.

Switching Schemes
-----------------

To switch schemes, select  `Plugins` ->  `Editor Scheme Selector`.
On the left, is a a list of available schemes, and on the right
you can select which sets of properties to set when applying a
scheme. Select the scheme in the list box to apply it.

To revert to the settings you had when you first opened the dialog,
select ``(Initial Settings)``.

Updating Schemes
----------------

To update a scheme, select `Plugins` -> `Editor Scheme Selector`. On
the left is a list of available schemes, and on the right you can
select which sets of properties to update. Schemes with a lock icon
(|READ_ONLY|) are read-only and cannot be updated. All the schemes
provided with EditorScheme are read-only. Schemes with a diamond
icon (|NORMAL|) can be updated. Choose the scheme you wish to update
and select `Update`.

.. |NORMAL|     image:: icons/normal.gif

``(Initial Settings)`` are the settings from when you opened the
`Editor Scheme Selector` dialog, and will not change as you
switch between schemes in the dialog.

Submitting Schemes
==================

To submit schemes for inclusion with EditorScheme, please send them
to Ollie Rutherfurd at <oliver@jedit.org>. It would be really nice
to have schemes from different jEdit users.
