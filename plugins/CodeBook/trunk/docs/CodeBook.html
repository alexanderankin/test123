      Code Book is a reference and code-completion plugin that depends on the parsing
      of Api documents for its source. Currently only Java is supported, but future releases
      will add support for other languages such as C, C++ and Python.
      <p>
      For suggestions on what languages to add support for, provided the language has some
      form of consistent documentation that can be automatically parsed, my e-mail is
      damienradtke@gmail.com. I am always looking for ways to improve this plugin,
      so general feedback is also welcome.

      This being the first release, the features list is fairly minimal.
      <p>
      Supported languages:
      <ul>
      	<li> Java
      	<ul>
      		<li> Code Completion
      		<li> Api Downloading
      	</ul>
      </ul>
      <p>
      Planned features:
      <ul>
      	<li> Api Lookup <i>(for quick Api referencing through InfoViewer)</i>
      	<li> Project support <i>(full reference of the active project)</i>
      	<li> SideKick variable parsing
      	<li> More languages
      </ul>

         </tr>
      </table>
      <p>
      Before code completion can be used, the plugin needs to parse some Api documents.
      It is highly recommended that you parse the standard Java documents (http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/),
      and for jEdit developers the jEdit api (http://www.jedit.org/api, or in doc/api of the
      jEdit installation directory). Be aware, though, that the parsing process can take
      some time, depending on the size of the Api and the internet speed. The Java Api, while
      extremely useful, is also quite large. Patience is a virtue.
      <p>
      To parse some documents go to Plugins -> Code Book, and then you have two options:
      <ul>
      	<li> Parse Local Java Api
      	<li> Parse Remote Java Api
      </ul>
      You can choose to parse Api documents on the internet, or if you
      have them saved locally you can parse them from your hard drive.
      If you parse a remote Api, all you need to do is enter in the URL of the root folder
      for the documents in the pop-up window. For parsing locally, a file browser will let you
      locate the root directory on your system. NOTE: both of these methods require selecting the
      root directory, which is the directory that includes "index.html", but do not include the
      file itself.
      <p>
      Once the plugin is done parsing, you can now activate code-completion. Completion is activated
      via the "Run Completion" action in the plugin menu, and it is highly recommended that you
      assign this to a shortcut key.
      <p>
      The Java completion has three modes, depending on what is in front of the cursor:
      <ul>
      	<li> "." : If the character in front of the cursor is a dot, then methods and fields
      		will be displayed.
      	<li> "(" : If it's an opening parenthese, constructors will be displayed.
      	<li> If none of these, then the package will be inserted, provided the word at the cursor
      		is a valid classname.
      </ul>
      <p>
      Basic buffer parsing for local variables is supported, but it is very limited, and only
      variables defined recently in the local scope will be found.

         <tr align=CENTER width="100%">
            <td bgcolor="#7FB2FF" width="100%">
               <strong><font color="#FFFFFF" size="+1"><a name=intro>Api Downloading</a></font></strong>

         </tr>
      </table>
      <p>
      Because sometimes internet can be slow, it may be better to download an Api and then parse
      it locally rather than parsing it remotely. This will also become extremely handy if you ever
      find yourself without internet but need to look up something in the Api. For these reasons,
      Code Book includes the ability to download a remote set of Api documents to your computer.
      <p>
      The downloading process is fairly simple. From the plugin menu select "Download Java Api".
      You will need to specify the URL for the remote Api, and then a file browser
      will pop up for you to choose where to save it. It is recommended that you create a new
      folder to save the documents to, otherwise there may be an explosion of files
      where you didn't expect there to be.
