			<h4>Introduction</h4>
			This plugin adds a fold handler that allows the user to specify the
			strings that define the start and end of a fold. It is based on the
			explicit fold handler and was originally written to provide folding
			on single brackets (for Java methods / classes). It hasn't been
			extensively tested on many different fold strings so there could
			be bugs. Any feedback and bug reports appreciated.
		</p>
		<p>
			<h4>Enabling Configurable Folding</h4>
			To enable configurable folding the folding mode must be set to
			&quot;custom&quot;. This is done from the folding mode drop downs
			in the buffer options dialog or by setting the default folding mode
			in global options->editing or global options->mode-specific options
			panes.
		</p>
		<p>
			<h4>Fold Strings</h4>
			Different fold strings can be specified for each edit mode and for
			individual buffers. Fold settings work in the same way as for other
			buffer settings. Global and mode-specific options are retained
			between jEdit sessions but buffer-specific fold strings are only
			retained as long as the buffer remains open.
		</p>
		<p>
			Fold strings cannot be blank. If invalid strings are entered there
			are currently no error messages (other than in the activity log) and
			folding is simply disabled. Folding is case sensitive.
		</p>
		<p>
			<h4>Regular Expressions</h4>
			If the "Use Regular Expressions" checkbox is selected then the fold
			handler will treat the strings as regular expressions and use them
			to match the start and end of folds. This is slower than normal
			matching and for large files might slow performance unacceptably.
		</p>
		<p>
			<h4>Multiple Fold Strings</h4>
			In order to match on multiple strings the "Use Regular Expressions"
			option should be enabled and the list of strings separated with the
			| (pipe) character. For example <code>public|private|if|switch
			</code>. If there are any regular expression special characters in
			the start or end strings then they'll need to be preceeded with a
			backslash ('\') character otherwise the folding won't work as
			anticipated. These characters include the following:
			<pre>
	* . \ ? + | [ ] ( ) ^</pre>
			There are probably many more but I'm not a regex guru and don't know
			the syntax particularly well.
		</p>

			<h4>Some Example Regular Expressions</h4>
				For folding XML files with no indent the following start and end
				strings can be used:
				<pre>
	&lt;[^!/\?].*?[^/-]&gt;
	&lt;/.*?&gt;</pre>
				These are by no means perfect. They will fail if an opening tag
				is broken across 2 or more lines, and there are probably other
				problems too. If anyone with a greater knowledge of regular
				expressions can improve them then please let me know.
			<p>
				For Java, C and C++ code the following are useful to fold on
				both brackets and range comments:
				<pre>
	{|/\*
	}|\*/</pre>
			</p>
			<p>
				If the start or end fold string is a substring of the other then
				normal folding will not work correctly. This can sometimes be
				worked around using regualar expressions. For example to match
				the strings <code>Function</code>, <code>End Function</code> the
				following regular expressions would work:
				<pre>
	^\s*Function
	End Function</pre>
			</p>
