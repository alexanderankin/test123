      <h4>Introduction</h4>
      This plugin adds a fold handler that allows the user to specify the
      strings that define the start and end of a fold.
    </p>
    <p>
      <h4>Enabling Configurable Folding</h4>
      To enable configurable folding the folding mode must be set to
      &quot;custom&quot;. This is done from the folding mode drop downs
      in the buffer options dialog or by setting the default folding mode
      in global options->editing or global options->mode-specific options
      panes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <h4>Fold Strings</h4>
      Different fold strings can be specified for each edit mode and for
      individual buffers. Fold settings work in the same way as for other
      buffer settings. Global and mode-specific options are retained
      between jEdit sessions but buffer-specific fold strings are only
      retained as long as the buffer remains open.
    </p>
    <p>
      Defaults fold strings for each mode are set in the Configurable Folding
      section of the Plugin Options dialog. Fold strings are set for each buffer
      individually using Plugins->Configurable Fold Handler->Buffer Fold
      Strings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fold strings cannot be blank. If invalid strings are entered in the Plugin
      Options dialog then an error message is displayed and folding is disabled
      for the selected mode. The Buffer Fold Strings dialog will not allow
      invalid strings to be entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      <h4>Regular Expressions</h4>
      If the "Use Regular Expressions" checkbox is selected then the fold
      handler will treat the strings as regular expressions and use them
      to match the start and end of folds. 
    </p>
    <p>
      <h4>Multiple Fold Strings</h4>
      In order to match on multiple strings the "Use Regular Expressions"
      option should be enabled and the list of strings separated with the
      | (pipe) character. For example <code>public|private|if|switch
      </code>. If there are any regular expression special characters in
      the start or end strings then they'll need to be preceeded with a
      backslash ('\') character otherwise the folding won't work as
      anticipated. These characters include the following:
      <pre>
  * . \ ? + | [ ] ( ) ^</pre>
    </p>
    <p>
      <h4>Some Example Regular Expressions</h4>
        For folding XML files with no indent the following start and end
        strings can be used:
        <pre>
  &lt;[^!/\?].*?[^/-]&gt;
  &lt;/.*?&gt;</pre>
        These only work properly if tags aren't broken across multiple lines.
      <p>
        For Java, C and C++ code the following are useful to fold on
        both brackets and range comments:
  <pre>
  \{|/\*
  \}|\*/</pre>
      </p>
      <p>
        If the start or end fold string is a substring of the other then
        normal folding will not work correctly. This can sometimes be
        worked around using regualar expressions. For example to match
        the strings <code>Function</code>, <code>End Function</code> the
        following regular expressions would work:
        <pre>
  (?&lt;!End )Function
  End Function</pre>
      </p>
      <p>
        The following versions are slightly more complete as they specify that the strings must be preceeded and followed by a word break (\b).
      <pre>
  (?&lt;!End )\bFunction\b
  \bEnd Function\b</pre>
      <p>
        If anyone has any other useful regular expressions or any default fold
        strings for any jEdit mode then please let me know and I'll include
        them.
      </p>
    </p>

      <h4>Manual folds</h4>
	  You can also use the plugin to create manual folds, by selecting a range
	  of lines and using "Plugins->Configurable Fold Handler->Create
	  ... fold for selected lines". Manual folds can be temporary or persistent.
	  Manual folds may be helpful, but they must be used with care:
	  <ul>
	  <li>They might break the folding of the buffer if they collide with
	  other folds (e.g. a manual fold in lines 5-8 would collide with another
	  fold in lines 6-10). Use manual folds only where they don't collide with
	  other folds.
	  <li>They are created using fixed line numbers, and do not move when lines
	  are inserted to the buffer or removed from it. It is recommended to use
	  manual folds only in buffers that will not be modified.
	  </ul>
