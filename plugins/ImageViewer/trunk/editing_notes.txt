Editing notes:

**** Not sure I want to do this, the original intent of ImageViewer is just to
be able to quickly look at images. Better might be to add an option to open the
image in another app like gimp or photoshop. Maybe take a look at ProjectViewer
and its 'Open in Desktop' option.

Want to add 2 editing features:
1. resize original
2. crop original

updates to Zoom:
Allow user to zoom to a particular size by pixel or percent.
   - need a dialog for width, height, units
Show the size.
Add option to show at 100%
Stay centered on zoom


Scaling:

Need dialog with:
Image Size
   Width
   Height
   lock
   units are always pixels
   resolution? gimp has this
   quality dropdown? gimp has these: none, linear, cubic, sinc (lanczos 3)
   buttons: scale, cancel, reset
   undo abilitiy


Crop:
regardless of current zoom
need cross hair cursor
mark drag/selection area
cancel selection
crop command
undo ability



Both:
Undo - redo current icons for rotate and reuse jEdit icon for undo
Save As
   - confirm on save as with same name
   
   
Toolbar:
replace with menu?
Add option for which side to show the toolbar
Add these:
   - right click on + or - zoom brings up zoom dialog for zoom to a specific
   pixel size or percent
   - show zoom percent and current pixel size
   - scale button
   - select button, turns on crop mode, crosshair cursor, etc
   - crop (to selection, not enabled if no selection)
   - save as button
   
Mouse listener:
right click shows popup menu
   - image properties
   - scale
   - center
   - zoom
   - crop (enable if selection)
   - select none (enable if selection)
   - rotate L & R
   - copy to clipboard
   - copy selection to clipboard?
   - save as
control-drag selects 


Possible menu:
File
   clear
   reload
   open
   save as
