<h1>ImageViewer Plugin</h1>
<b>
Author: Dale Anson

<br>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
A simple image viewer.  This image viewer lets you view images from ProjectViewer
or from the File System Browser in a dockable window.  Zoom in and zoom out
are the only features.  There are no editing capabilities.
<p>
At this time, only .gif, .jpg, and .png files are supported as these are
the file types supported internally by Java.
<p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
To use, right click on an image file in ProjectViewer and select the
"View Image" item.
<p>
In the File System Browser, click on Plugins, Image Viewer, View Image.
<p>
In the ImageViewer itself, there are three controls:
<ul>
<li>Clear - clear the ImageViewer display.</li>
<li>Zoom in - zoom in on the image for a closer look</li>
<li>Zoom out - zoom out on the image</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b><i>A word of caution:</i></b> Zooming in is unrestricted by the plugin, but
is likely restricted by your physical RAM.  It is quite easy to open a large
size image and zoom in until you are out of memory.
<h2>Options</h2>
There are two options available on the plugin options:
<ul>
<li>Show images on mouse over in File System Browser</li>
<li>Show images on mouse over in ProjectViewer</li>
</ul>

If these options are checked, then simply moving your mouse over an image
file in either the File System Browser or ProjectViewer will display the
image in ImageViewer.
