<h1>ImageViewer Plugin</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>A simple image viewer.  This image viewer lets you view images from ProjectViewer
or from the File System Browser in a dockable window.  Zoom in and zoom out, and
rotate clockwise and counter-clockwise are the only features.  There are no 
editing capabilities, although there is an "Open in Desktop" button that will open
the image in the application associated via the system desktop.
</p>
<p>
At this time, only .gif, .jpg, and .png files are supported as these are
the file types supported internally by Java. </p>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>
To use, first make sure the ImageViewer dockable is visible. It can be 
selected from the Plugin - ImageViewer menu item. </p>
<p> 
Next, right click on an image file in ProjectViewer and select the 
"View Image" item. </p>
<p>
Or, in the File System Browser, click on Plugins, Image Viewer, View Image. 
</p>
<p>
See below for instructions on option settings to make selecting an image even
easier.
</p>

<p>
In the ImageViewer itself, there is a toolbar with these buttons: </p>

<ul>
<li>Clear - clear the ImageViewer display.</li>
<li>Copy - copy the image to the clipboard for pasting into another application.</li>
<li>Zoom in - zoom in on the image for a closer look.</li>
<li>Zoom out - zoom out on the image.</li>
<li>Rotate clockwise - rotate 90 degrees.</li>
<li>Rotate counter-clockwise - rotate -90 degrees</li>
<li>Reload - reload the image and restore it to its original size.</li>
<li>Info - show any Exif, IPTC, XMP, ICC, and other metadata from the image</li>
<li>Open in Desktop - open the image in the application associated via the system desktop</li>
</ul>
<p>
These items are also found on the Plugins - Image Viewer menu.
<p>
<b><i>A word of caution:</i></b> Zooming in is unrestricted by the plugin, but
is likely restricted by your physical RAM.  It is quite easy to open a large
size image and zoom in until you are out of memory. </p>
<p>
There are mouse actions: </p>
<ul>
<li>Double click on a spot in an image to center that spot in the viewer.</li>
<li>Click and drag moves the image.</li>
<li>Rolling the mouse wheel zooms in and out.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Options</h2>
There are these options available on the plugin options.  Turning on some of
these makes it easier to scan images quickly.  Otherwise, you'll have to use
the menus from the File System Browser or ProjectViewer to display the
images, which can be slow and cumbersome.

<ul>
<li>Show images on mouse over/click in File System Browser </li>
<li>Show images on mouse over/click in ProjectViewer (This option is only 
available if ProjectViewer is available.) </li>
<li>Display on mouse over or mouse click</li>
</ul>
<p>
If the first two options are checked, then clicking on a node in either tree 
(ProjectViewer or File System Browser) will display the image in ImageViewer.
</p>
<p>
You can also select whether to show the image on a mouse over or a mouse
click.  The mouse over is handy when you want to quickly locate a particular
image from a long list of images, but you may find that too distracting and
might prefer to click on individual image files to display them.</p>

<h2> Changes </h2>
<p>
<b>Version 1.4</b>
<ul>
<li>Fixed rotate clockwise and counter-clockwise so the image isn't distorted.</li>
<li>Added "Info" button to display any Exif, IPTC, XMP, ICC, and other metadata.</li>
<li>Added "Open in Desktop" button to open the image with the application
associated via the sytem desktop.</li>
<li>Fixed the plugin menu so that it actually shows.</li>
<li>Reversed direction on mouse wheel so zoom works like Google Maps (personally,
I think this is backwards, pulling the wheel toward you should pull the image
toward you, making it bigger, not the other way around, but I'll go along with
this for the sake of consistency.)</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>Version 1.3</b>
<ul>
<li>Added rotate clockwise and counter-clockwise to make it easier to see
images that need rotated to be in an upright position.</li>
<li>Initial image size is now automatically adjusted for height if it is too 
tall to fit in the viewer. This makes it easier to see a complete image.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Version 1.2</b>
<ul>
<li>Added "copy" action so the image can be copied to the system clipboard.</li>
<li>Added actions to Plugin menu.</li>
<li>Added ".jpeg" as an allowable file name extension.</li>
<li>Fix for tracker 2924797, the JVM caches images loaded with ImageIcon, so
if the image is changed with an external program, ImageViewer was not aware 
of the change.  I changed the way images are loaded so using the "Refresh" 
button will now reload the image from disk rather than the JVM cache.  This
should also improve memory usage, since the JVM would generally cache images
for the life of the JVM session.
<li>Removed support for old version of ProjectViewer since 2.9 is now available.</li>
<li>No longer pops up dockable automatically in response to tree node 
hovers/clicks. Added MenuItem to select dockable manually. (Alan Ezust) </li>
