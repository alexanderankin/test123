<h1>ImageViewer Plugin</h1>
<b>

<br>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
A simple image viewer.  This image viewer lets you view images from ProjectViewer
or from the File System Browser in a dockable window.  Zoom in and zoom out
are the only features.  There are no editing capabilities.
<p>
At this time, only .gif, .jpg, and .png files are supported as these are
the file types supported internally by Java.
<p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
To use, right click on an image file in ProjectViewer and select the
"View Image" item.
<p>
In the File System Browser, click on Plugins, Image Viewer, View Image.
<p>
In the ImageViewer itself, there are four controls:
<ul>
<li>Clear - clear the ImageViewer display.</li>
<li>Zoom in - zoom in on the image for a closer look.</li>
<li>Zoom out - zoom out on the image.</li>
<li>Reload - reload the image and restore it to its original size.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b><i>A word of caution:</i></b> Zooming in is unrestricted by the plugin, but
is likely restricted by your physical RAM.  It is quite easy to open a large
size image and zoom in until you are out of memory.
<p>
There are mouse actions:
<ul>
<li>Double click on a spot in an image to center that spot in the viewer.</li>
<li>Click and drag moves the image.</li>
<li>Rolling the mouse wheel zooms in and out.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Options</h2>
There are these options available on the plugin options.  Turning on some of
these makes it easier to scan images quickly.  Otherwise, you'll have to use
the menus from the File System Browser or ProjectViewer to display the
images, which can be slow and cumbersome.

<ul>
<li>Show images on mouse over/click in File System Browser
<br>
<ul><li>Show only if ImageViewer is visible</li></ul>
</li>
<li>Show images on mouse over/click in ProjectViewer (This option is only available
if ProjectViewer is available.)
<br>
<ul><li>Show only if ImageViewer is visible</li></ul>
</li>
<li>Display on mouse over or mouse click</li>
</ul>

If the first two options are checked, then simply moving your mouse over an image
file in either the File System Browser or ProjectViewer will display the
image in ImageViewer.  Each of these options has a sub-option: "Show only if 
ImageViewer is visible".  If this sub-option is selected, then mousing-over
an image file won't show the image in ImageViewer unless the ImageViewer
itself is already visible.
<p>
You can also select whether to show the image on a mouse over or a mouse
click.  The mouse over is handy when you want to quickly locate a particular
image from a long list of images, but you may find that too distracting and
might prefer to click on individual image files to display them.
