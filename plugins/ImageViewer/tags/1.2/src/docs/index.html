<h1>ImageViewer Plugin</h1>
<b>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
A simple image viewer.  This image viewer lets you view images from ProjectViewer
or from the File System Browser in a dockable window.  Zoom in and zoom out
are the only features.  There are no editing capabilities.
<p>
At this time, only .gif, .jpg, and .png files are supported as these are
the file types supported internally by Java. </p>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>To use, first make sure the ImageViewer dockable is visible. It can be 
selected from the Plugin - ImageViewer menu item. </p>
<p> Next, right click on an image file in ProjectViewer and select the 
"View Image" item. </p>
<p>
Or, in the File System Browser, click on Plugins, Image Viewer, View Image. 
</p>

<p>
In the ImageViewer itself, there is a toolbar with these buttons: </p>

<ul>
<li>Clear - clear the ImageViewer display.</li>
<li>Copy - copy the image to the clipboard for pasting into another application.</li>
<li>Zoom in - zoom in on the image for a closer look.</li>
<li>Zoom out - zoom out on the image.</li>
<li>Reload - reload the image and restore it to its original size.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b><i>A word of caution:</i></b> Zooming in is unrestricted by the plugin, but
is likely restricted by your physical RAM.  It is quite easy to open a large
size image and zoom in until you are out of memory. </p>
<p>
There are mouse actions: </p>
<ul>
<li>Double click on a spot in an image to center that spot in the viewer.</li>
<li>Click and drag moves the image.</li>
<li>Rolling the mouse wheel zooms in and out.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Options</h2>
There are these options available on the plugin options.  Turning on some of
these makes it easier to scan images quickly.  Otherwise, you'll have to use
the menus from the File System Browser or ProjectViewer to display the
images, which can be slow and cumbersome.

<ul>
<li>Show images on mouse over/click in File System Browser </li>
<li>Show images on mouse over/click in ProjectViewer (This option is only 
available if ProjectViewer is available.) </li>
<li>Display on mouse over or mouse click</li>
</ul>
<p>
If the first two options are checked, then clicking on a node in either tree 
(ProjectViewer or File System Browser) will display the image in ImageViewer.
</p>
<p>
You can also select whether to show the image on a mouse over or a mouse
click.  The mouse over is handy when you want to quickly locate a particular
image from a long list of images, but you may find that too distracting and
might prefer to click on individual image files to display them.</p>

<h2> Changes </h2>
<p>
<b>Version 1.2</b>
<ul>
<li>Added "copy" action so the image can be copied to the system clipboard.</li>
<li>Added actions to Plugin menu.</li>
<li>Added ".jpeg" as an allowable file name extension.</li>
<li>Fix for tracker 2924797, the JVM caches images loaded with ImageIcon, so
if the image is changed with an external program, ImageViewer was not aware 
of the change.  I changed the way images are loaded so using the "Refresh" 
button will now reload the image from disk rather than the JVM cache.  This
should also improve memory usage, since the JVM would generally cache images
for the life of the JVM session.
<li>Removed support for old version of ProjectViewer since 2.9 is now available.</li>
<li>No longer pops up dockable automatically in response to tree node 
hovers/clicks. Added MenuItem to select dockable manually. (Alan Ezust) </li>
</ul>

<b>Version 1.1</b>

</ul>
