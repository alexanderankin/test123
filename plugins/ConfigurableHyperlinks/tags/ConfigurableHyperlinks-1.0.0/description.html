<p>This is a Hyperlinks implementation that allows users to specify their own hyperlink 
styles with an XML configuration file, instead of needing to write their own plugin. 
Here are some potential uses for this plugin:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Hyperlink identifiers in source code to their definitions</li>
  <li>Hyperlink specific file paths to open in a new buffer</li>
  <li>Hyperlink to another part of large file using a line number</li>
</ul>
