- Bug 2043623: The action to switch to a dockable should also set the keyboard
  focus to the dockable.
- Bug 2043578: Add an action and button in a ToolWindowBar to hide/show the entire
  ToolWindowBar, preserving the splits (the aggregate mode).
- Look and feel: Use jEdit style for ToolWindows and ToolWindowBars.
- A pop up message when the docking framework is changed, saying jEdit should be
  restarted for the new setting to take effect.
- FastOpen plugin: With DWM, pops up floating. With MyDoggy, docked.
- Document the plugin (user guide).
