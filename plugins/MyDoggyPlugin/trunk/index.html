<h2>Description</h2>
</a>

<p>
MyDoggyPlugin brings the power of the open-source docking framework named
MyDoggy to jEdit. It uses MyDoggy to manage the dockable windows in jEdit, so
they can be dragged from one docking area to another, share the same docking
area, and a lot more.
</p>

<a name="usage">
<h2>Usage</h2>
</a>

<p>
To use MyDoggyPlugin, go to
<tt>Utilities-&gt;Global Options-&gt;Appearance-&gt;Docking framework</tt>
and select MyDoggy as the docking framework.
</p>

<p>
To learn how to use MyDoggy, please visit the
<a href="http://mydoggy.sourceforge.net/">MyDoggy website</a>. <br>
It contains a demo of MyDoggy you can experiment with until you get familiar
with it. Please note: MyDoggy is a very rich docking framework, and many
things may surprise you, so it's better to experiment with the demo
prior to trying it with jEdit. For example, in contrast to other docking
frameworks, MyDoggy provides several modes for floating windows, and several
modes for docking windows. It also allows multiple dockables to share the same
docking area (e.g. 3 dockables can split the bottom docking area between them).
The later is called "Aggregation mode". Please experiment with it in the demo
until you get used to it, otherwise it might annoy you.

<h2>Options</h2>
</a>

<p>
MyDoggyPlugin provides several customization options in its plugin options:
<ul>
<li> Push away mode: This option allows you to define how the 4 docking areas
(top, bottom, right, left) split the window area between them, e.g. whether
the top and bottom areas take the entire window width and the right and left
areas are between them, or vice versa. Experiment with the options until you
find the one that you like most.
<li> Override push-away mode with jEdit alternate docking layout property: If
this option is selected, MyDoggyPlugin will use the push-away mode that is
specified for jEdit
(<tt>Global Options-&gt;View-&gt;Alternate docked window placement</tt>).
<li> Make floating dockables "Always on top": If this option is selected,
floating dockables will be on top of the jEdit window.
<li> Add OS decorations to floating dockables: By default, floating dockables
in MyDoggy have their own custom frame, which is different from ordinary OS
windows. If this option is selected, floating dockables will be placed inside
a regular OS window frame.
<li> Add floating dockables to the task bar: Specifies whether or not floating
dockables should be added to the OS taskbar as separate tasks.
<li> Enable preview of minimized dockables: If selected, hovering the mouse
cursor over the button of a minimized dockable in the dockable bar shows a
preview of the dockable contents.
<li> Enable animations for docked dockables: If selected, hiding/showing
dockables will show animations (the active window being minimized, the new
window being opened).
</ul>
