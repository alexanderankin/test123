<h1>LaTeX Tools Plugin.</h1>

<p>This plugin is a collection of tools to make LaTeX editing an easier and
quicker task. The tools are generally inactive unless the current buffer is a
LaTeX file. There are four docking windows available, and several additional
tools available through the LaTeX Tools menu:</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>This version of LaTeX Tools has added the concept of a LaTeX project,
which consists of a main file along with all of the files (recursively)
imported by the main file.</p>

<p>A main file can be specified either globally or locally. The global
setting is done through the plugin menu, where <em>Set Main File</em> sets
the global main file to the current file, and <em>Reset Main File</em>
removes the global property. The local setting is achieved by adding
somewhere in the first 5 lines of the file the string
<code>:latex.root=<em>Absolute or relative path to Main file</em>:</code>.
The menu command <em>Show Main File</em> displays the path to the main file
in a pop up box. Note that if present, the locally defined Main file has
priority, followed by the globally defined property. If no local or global
properties have been set, then the current buffer is deemed to be the Main
file.</p>

<p>The main file is used by several other commands, such as the
<em>Compile</em> commands, the <em>BiBTex</em>  command and the <em>Erase
Working Files...</em> command. It is also used by the Label Navigator and the
BibTeX Navigator in order to correctly parse information. <em>The project
files</em> is a term used in these instructions to refer to the set of files
that include the Main file and all files imported by files in the set.</p>

<h5>Note: Recognized buffer modes</h5>

<p>LaTeX Tools function correctly only if the buffer is recognized as a
(La)TeX buffer. At present, the following buffer modes are recognized as tex
modes: tex, latex.</p>
<a name="latextools"></a>

<h2>LaTeX Tools Window</h2>
The LaTeX Tools window has two functions, firstly to display a list of
possible structure filters for the Structure Browser to use. The current
filter is displayed, and changing the filter causes the Structure Browser to
reparse the current buffer. The second function is to display information
about the project. The type of information is chosen by clicking one of the
tool buttons. Currently, <em>Information</em> <img alt="Information"
src="images/info.png"> shows the projects main file, and a tree display of
the files imported by the main file and its children. <em>View Image</em>
<img alt="View Image" src="images/image.png"> looks for a graphics command
under the caret, and if it finds one with a displayable image it will display
the image in the information panel. Since this only displays jpeg, gif and
png images currently, this is most useful to users of PDFLaTeX. The last two
buttons are <em>Find Duplicates</em> <img alt="Find Duplicates"
src="images/duplicate.png"> and <em>Find Orphans</em> <img alt="Find Orphans"
src="images/orphan.png">. These search the project files for duplicate label
definitions, and references to missing labels respectively. The duplicate
labels or orphaned references are displayed in a list, and can be clicked to
move the caret to that reference or label. <a name="nav"></a>

<h2>Structure Browser</h2>

<p>This feature implements a document navigator. By default all special
elements of the document are displayed in the SideKick structure browser.
Controls for selecting a filter for the document elements to parse are
included in the <a href="#latextools">LaTeX Tools dockable</a>. Several
filters are predefined, but user defined lists can be added to or replace
these filters, as described below.</p>

<h3>Suggested use.</h3>
The way I use the document navigator is to have the Structure Browser docked
to the right, and LaTeX Tools docked at the top (it is one line deep, so
doesn't take much space). This way it is easy to select the features of the
document you wish to see. If you simply want all of the main elements
displayed, don't bother with the toolbar - it is the default parser.

<h3>User defined Navigation Lists.</h3>

<p>User defined navigation lists are text files with a <tt>.nav</tt> extension, containing search data for
parsing the document, and are placed in the directory specified in the Global
Options for the LaTeX Navigator. They have the following syntax:</p>

<p>Navigation lists must have a title as the first line of the list, of the
format, "@<i>title</i><b>n</b>". <i>title</i> is the name displayed in the
combo box; <b>n</b> is a single digit, giving the preferred position in the
combo box (1 being the top, 9 being the bottom) or 0 if it should not appear
at all. Users can override default lists by adding a new list of the same
name to a user list - user lists take precedent over the defaults.</p>

<p>Following the title tag are the lines defining the search strings to look
for in the text. These must be of the format, "<strong>N:start search
string:replace string:end type:end search string:I</strong> ". where
<strong>N</strong>  is the nesting level of the search string, and
<strong>I</strong>  is the icon to use in the sidekick tree.</p>

<p>The <strong>start search string</strong>  is parsed as a regular
expression (so if simple definitions are required, remember to escape special
characters).</p>

<p>The <strong>replace string</strong>  is an ordinary string, but the
strings $1, $2, etc can be used to refer to captured groups in the search
string. If the replace string is simply a "Â " (space) character, then any
captured groups are concatenated and used as the text in the tree, or if no
capturing groups are present, then the whole found string (group $0) is used
as the tree text. Either a replace expression, or single space should be used
as the replace string - other strings may have unpredictable results. Note
also that if the ':' symbol is required in either search or replace string,
the unicode escape \u003A should be used, or the navigation item will not be
parsed correctly. An example from the default navigation file follows:</p>

<p>The <strong>end type</strong> gives the type of scope the element has, and
is used in conjunction with the <strong>end search string</strong>  to
determine the scope of the element. The types are:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The end of scope is set to the end of the buffer.</li>
  <li>The end of scope is set to the end of the start search string.</li>
  <li>The end of scope is set to the end of the end search string.</li>
</ol>

<p>Each type is appropriate for different types of element. In general
sections should be type 0, commands should be type 1 and environments should
be type 2.</p>

<p>Note that the Sections group in this example will only print the section
title in the tree. The strings "Thm" etc will be displayed in the case of the
Theorems group, along with the description if present.</p>

      <td>7</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
Any other integer value will display no image at all. <a name="bibtex"></a>

<h2>BibTeX Navigator</h2>

<p>This tool searches the project files for a
<code>\begin{thebibliography}</code> environment, or  a
<code>\bibliography{}</code> command. If the former is found, the current
file is searched for <code>\bibitem</code> commands, and compiles a list of
such entries. If the latter is found, then all referenced bib files are
searched for the reference names and reference titles, and a table compiled
containing these.</p>

<p>A dialog is displayed, from which a selection (or selections if the CTRL
keys are held down whilst clicking or dragging on table entries) can be made.
Once ENTER is pressed, all citations are entered at the cursor position in
the current buffer as a comma delimited list. Alternatively, you can insert
an entry by double clicking on it. The dialog is canceled by pressing ESCAPE,
by closing the dialog window, or by hitting ENTER with no selections made.</p>

<p>The table of BibTeX references may be sorted by other column than "Ref" by
clicking once the column header ("Title", "Author", "Journal" or "Ref"
again). (The other fields are only shown when editing a .bib file.) To sort
in the descending order, hold Shift while clicking on it. To change the
current sort order, just click the header for the second time (but not too
fast after the 1st click).</p>

<p></p>

<h3>Options</h3>
<ul>
  <li><p>Include Tag. If this is selected, then the string \cite{ and } are
    inserted around the citations on enter.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Maximum Letters in Title. The integer value gives the maximum number
    of letters per word in the title. If set to 0, the title is left intact.
    For example, if the value is set to 3, then "The Users Guide to jEdit" is
    abbreviated to "The Use Gui to jEd".</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Maximum Words in Title. The integer value gives the maximum number
    of words in the title. For example, if the value is set to 3, then "The
    Users Guide to jEdit" is abbreviated to "The Users Guide".</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<a name="label"></a>

<h2>Label Navigator</h2>

<p>When activated, this tool simply searches the project files for
<code>\label{}</code> commands, and displays the results in a dialog. Only
single label can be selected (multiple references in a single
<code>\ref</code> are not supported in LaTeX as they are in
<code>\cite</code> commands).</p>

<p>Clicking a label has the following effects:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Single Click</strong>: "locks" the insertion point for the
    reference to the cursor position of the current buffer. This saves the
    cursor position and buffer, so that clicking the table entries navigates
    the documents, but double clicking inserts the reference at the original
    location. The lock is released when a click is performed with the ALT key
    held down and when the mouse exits the table.</li>
  <li><strong>Alt-Click</strong>: Removes any lock and scrolls to the label
    in the appropriate buffer. Note that this may change the current buffer
    and caret position.</li>
  <li><strong>Double Click</strong>: inserts a reference to the label at the
    cursor position in the current buffer.</li>
</ul>
The locking mechanism allows the entire list of labels to be explored by
clicking the labels to view their positions. Double clicking a reference will
insert the reference at the saved cursor location.

<h3>Options</h3>
<ul>
  <li><p>Include Tag. If this is selected, then the string \ref{ and } are
    inserted around the citations on enter.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<a name="commands"></a>

<h2>Other Tools</h2>
Various utility commands are included, accessible through the Plugins menu.
These are catagorized as follows:

<h3>Compilation</h3>
There are six commands here. <em>Compile</em> runs the default compilation
command on the current buffer using the Console plugin. The
<em>Compile...</em> command allows the user to specify the compilation
command in a text box (which maintains a history of commands). <em>View
Output</em> and <em>View Output...</em> are similar, but for the output of
the compilation (eg. Acrobat Reader, DVI, ghostview etc). <em>BibTeX</em>
runs BibTeX on the current buffer, again through the Console. <em>Erase
Working Files...</em> displays a checkbox list of file extensions, and
deletes all files in the same directory as the Main file with those
extensions (giving plenty of opportunity to pull out at the last minute!).

<h3>LaTeX Utilities</h3>
<em>Rename Label</em> opens dialogs asking for the current name of the label,
and the new name. The project files are then examined, and all labels and
references matching the first string are changed to the second. <em>Display
Image</em>, <em>Find Duplicate Labels</em> and <em>Find Orphaned
References</em> open the LaTeX Tools dockable window with the appropriate
information displayed.

<h3>Text Insertion</h3>
These are various shortcuts to manipulate text. They are pretty self
explanatory so play around...

<h3>Project Management</h3>
These are the commands <em>Set Main File</em>, <em>Reset Main File</em> and
<em>Show Main File Path</em>. These are described in <a
href="#project">Project Management</a> above.

<h3>Navigation</h3>

<p>The commands <em>BibTeX Navigator</em>, <em>Label Navigator</em>
<em>Structure Browser</em> and  <em>LaTeX Information Panel</em>  simply open
the relevant dockable windows.</p>

<p><em>Open Main File</em> simply opens the Main file as the current buffer.
<em>Open Import</em> looks to see if there is an import statement under the
caret, and if so tries to open the import file.</p>
