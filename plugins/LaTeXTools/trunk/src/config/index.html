<h1>LaTeX Tools Plugin.</h1>

<p>This plugin is a collection of tools to make LaTeX editing an
easier and quicker task. The tools are generally inactive unless
the current buffer is a LaTeX file. The tools available at
present include the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#bibtex">BibTeX completion</a></li>

<li><a href="#label">Reference Completion</a></li>

<li><a href="#nav">LaTeX Navigator</a></li>

<li><a href="history.html">Release Notes</a></li>

<li><a href="featurereq.html">Feature Requests</a></li>
</ul>

<a name="bibtex"></a> 

<h2>BibTeX Completion</h2>

<p>This tool searches for a <code>\begin{thebibliography}</code>
environment, or failing that looks for a
<code>\bibliography{}</code> command. If the former is found, the
current file is searched for <code>\bibitem</code> commands, and
compiles a list of such entries. If the latter is found, then all
referenced bib files are searched for the reference names and
reference titles, and a table compiled containing these.</p>

<p>A dialog is displayed, from which a selection (or selections
if the ALT or CTRL keys are held down whilst clicking on table
entries) can be made. Once ENTER is pressed, all entries are
entered at the cursor position in the current buffer as a comma
delimited list. The dialog is cancelled by pressing ESCAPE, by
closing the dialog window, or by hitting ENTER with no selections
made.</p>

<h3>Options</h3>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Include Tag. If this is selected, then the string \cite{ and }
are inserted around the citations on enter.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Maximum Letters in Title. The integer value gives the maximum
number of letters per word in the title. If set to 0, the title
is left intact. For example, if the value is set to 3, then
&quot;The Users Guide to jEdit&quot; is abbreviated to &quot;The
Use Gui to jEd&quot;.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Maximum Words in Title. The integer value gives the maximum
number of words in the title. For example, if the value is set to
3, then &quot;The Users Guide to jEdit&quot; is abbreviated to
&quot;The Users Guide&quot;.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<a name="label"></a> 

<h2>Reference Completion</h2>

<p>When activated, this tool simply searches the current buffer
for <code>\label{}</code> commands, and displays the results in a
dialog. Only single references can be selected (multiple
references in a single <code>\ref</code> are not supported in
LaTeX as they are in <code>\cite</code> commands), and are
inserted in the document when enter is pressed.</p>

<h3>Options</h3>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Include Tag. If this is selected, then the string \ref{ and }
are inserted around the citations on enter.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<a name="nav"></a> 

<h2>LaTeX Navigator</h2>

<p>This feature implements a document navigator. When activated,
a dialog pops up, displaying a combo box showing the default
navigation list, and a tree displaying a list of relevant items
in the document. For example, the default navigation list is
&quot;Sections&quot;, and displayed is a tree showing the
hierarchy of section headings in the document.</p>

<p>Clicking on a node of the tree takes you to the appropriate
line in the document. Hitting enter or escape closes the dialog.
Changing the selection in the combo box reparses the document for
the new navigation list.</p>

<h3>User defined Navigation Lists.</h3>

<p>User defined navigation lists are text files containing search
data for parsing the document, and are placed in the directory
specified in the Global Options for the LaTeX Navigator. They
have the following syntax:</p>

<p>Navigation lists must have a title as the first line of the
list, of the format, &quot;@<i>title</i><b>n</b>&quot;.
<i>title</i> is the name displayed in the combo box; <b>n</b> is
a single digit, giving the preferred position in the combo box (1
being the top, 9 being the bottom) or 0 if it should not appear
at all. Users can override default lists by adding a new list of
the same name to a user list - user lists take precedent over the
defaults.</p>

<p>Following the title tag are the lines defining the search
strings to look for in the text. These must be of the format,
&quot;<b>n</b>:<i>search string</i>&quot;. where (the single
digit) <b>n</b> is the nesting level of the search string. Regular expressions are used (so if simple definitions are required, remember to escape special characters), and if capturing groups are used, the first such group is used as the text in the tree. An
example of such a file follows:</p>

<br>

<div style="padding-left:4em;background:#dddddd">
<pre>
@Sections2
1:(\\chapter\{.+?\})
  2:(\\section\{.+?\})
    3:(\\subsection\{.+?\})
      4:(\\subsubsection\{.+?\})
        5:(\\paragraph\{.+?\})

@Theorems4
1:\\begin\{theorem\}
1:\\begin\{lemma\}
1:\\begin\{proposition\}
1:\\begin\{definition\}
1:\\begin\{corollary\}
2:\\begin\{proof\}
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Note that the Sections group in this example will only print the section title in the tree, where the whole string found will be displayed in the case of the Theorems group.
