<h1>LaTeX Tools Plugin.</h1>

<p>This plugin is a collection of tools to make LaTeX editing an
easier and quicker task. The tools are generally inactive unless
the current buffer is a LaTeX file. The tools available at
present include the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#bibtex">BibTeX completion</a></li>

<li><a href="#label">Reference Completion</a></li>

<li><a href="#nav">LaTeX Navigator</a></li>

<li><a href="history.html">Release Notes</a></li>
<!-- <li><a href="bugs.html">Bugs List</a></li>
<li><a href="featurereq.html">Feature Requests</a></li>
 --></ul>

<a name="bibtex"></a>

<h2>BibTeX Completion</h2>

<p>This tool searches for a <code>\begin{thebibliography}</code>
environment, or failing that looks for a
<code>\bibliography{}</code> command. If the former is found, the
current file is searched for <code>\bibitem</code> commands, and
compiles a list of such entries. If the latter is found, then all
referenced bib files are searched for the reference names and
reference titles, and a table compiled containing these.</p>

<p>A dialog is displayed, from which a selection (or selections
if the ALT or CTRL keys are held down whilst clicking on table
entries) can be made. Once ENTER is pressed, all entries are
entered at the cursor position in the current buffer as a comma
delimited list. The dialog is cancelled by pressing ESCAPE, by
closing the dialog window, or by hitting ENTER with no selections
made.</p>

<h3>Options</h3>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Include Tag. If this is selected, then the string \cite{ and }
are inserted around the citations on enter.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Maximum Letters in Title. The integer value gives the maximum
number of letters per word in the title. If set to 0, the title
is left intact. For example, if the value is set to 3, then
&quot;The Users Guide to jEdit&quot; is abbreviated to &quot;The
Use Gui to jEd&quot;.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Maximum Words in Title. The integer value gives the maximum
number of words in the title. For example, if the value is set to
3, then &quot;The Users Guide to jEdit&quot; is abbreviated to
&quot;The Users Guide&quot;.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<a name="label"></a>

<h2>Reference Completion</h2>

<p>When activated, this tool simply searches the current buffer
for <code>\label{}</code> commands, and displays the results in a
dialog. Only single references can be selected (multiple
references in a single <code>\ref</code> are not supported in
LaTeX as they are in <code>\cite</code> commands), and are
inserted in the document when enter is pressed.</p>

<h3>Options</h3>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Include Tag. If this is selected, then the string \ref{ and }
are inserted around the citations on enter.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<a name="nav"></a>

<h2>LaTeX Navigator</h2>

<p>This feature implements a document navigator. By default all special
elements of the document are displayed in the SideKick structure browser.
A separate (dockable) dialog has controls for selecting the document
elements to parse - a few are predefined, but user defined lists can add to
or replace these, as described below.
</p>

<h3>Suggested use.</h3>

The way I use the document navigator is to have the Structure Browser docked to the right, and the Navigation Toolbar docked at the top (it is one line deep, so doesn't take much space). This way it is easy to select the features of the document you wish to see. If you simply want all of the main elements displayed, don't bother with the toolbar - it is the default parser.

<h3>User defined Navigation Lists.</h3>

<p>User defined navigation lists are text files containing search
data for parsing the document, and are placed in the directory
specified in the Global Options for the LaTeX Navigator. They
have the following syntax:</p>

<p>Navigation lists must have a title as the first line of the
list, of the format, &quot;@<i>title</i><b>n</b>&quot;.
<i>title</i> is the name displayed in the combo box; <b>n</b> is
a single digit, giving the preferred position in the combo box (1
being the top, 9 being the bottom) or 0 if it should not appear
at all. Users can override default lists by adding a new list of
the same name to a user list - user lists take precedent over the
defaults.</p>

<p>Following the title tag are the lines defining the search
strings to look for in the text. These must be of the format,
&quot;<strong>N:search string:replace string:I</strong> &quot;. where <strong>N</strong>  is the nesting level of the search string, and <strong>I</strong>  is the icon to use in the sidekick tree.
</p>
<p>
 The <strong>search string</strong>  is parsed as a regular expression (so if simple definitions are required, remember to escape special characters). </p>
 <p>
 The <strong>replace string</strong>  is an ordinary string, but the strings $1, $2, etc can be used to refer to captured groups in the search string. If the replace string is simply a "&nbsp;" (space) character, then any captured groups are concatenated and used as the text in the tree, or if no capturing groups are present, then the whole found string (group $0) is used as the tree text. Either a replace expression, or single space should be used as the replace string - other strings may have unpredictable results. Note also that if the ':' symbol is required in either search or replace string, the unicode escape \u003A should be used, or the navigation item will not be parsed correctly. An
example from the default navigation file follows:</p>

<br>

<div style="padding-left:4em;background:#dddddd">
<pre>
@Sections2
1:\\chapter\{(.+?)\}: :1
2:\\section\{(.+?)\}: :1
3:\\subsection\{(.+?)\}: :1
4:\\subsubsection\{(.+?)\}: :1
5:\\paragraph\{(.+?)\}: :1

@Theorems4
1:\\begin\{theorem\}(\[.+?\])?:Thm\u003A $1:3
1:\\begin\{lemma\}(\[.+?\])?:Lem\u003A $1:3
1:\\begin\{proposition\}(\[.+?\])?:Prp\u003A $1:3
1:\\begin\{definition\}(\[.+?\])?:Dfn\u003A $1:3
1:\\begin\{corollary\}(\[.+?\])?:Cor\u003A $1:3
2:\\begin\{proof\}(\[.+?\])?:Proof\u003A $1:0

</pre>
</div>
<p>
Note that the Sections group in this example will only print the section title in the tree. The strings "Thm" etc will be displayed in the case of the Theorems group, along with the description if present.
</p>

<p>The integers for various icons are as follows:</p>

<table width="50%">
<tr>
<td><img alt="default" src="images/default.png"></td><td>Default</td><td>0</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img alt="section" src="images/sections.png"></td><td>Section</td><td>1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img alt="graphics" src="images/graphics.png"></td><td>Graphics</td><td>2</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img alt="theorem" src="images/theorem.png"></td><td>Theorem</td><td>3</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img alt="table" src="images/table.png"></td><td>Table</td><td>4</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img alt="list" src="images/list.png"></td><td>List</td><td>5</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img alt="list" src="images/verbatim.png"></td><td>Verbatim</td><td>6</td>
</tr>
</table>
Any other integer value will display no image at all.
