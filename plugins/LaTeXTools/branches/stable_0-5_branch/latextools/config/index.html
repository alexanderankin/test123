<h1>LaTeX Tools Plugin.</h1>

<p>This plugin is a collection of tools to make LaTeX editing an
easier and quicker task. The tools are generally inactive unless
the current buffer is a LaTeX file. The tools available at
present include the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#project">Project Management</a></li>

<li><a href="#commands">Useful Commands</a></li>

<li><a href="#bibtex">BibTeX completion</a></li>

<li><a href="#label">Reference Completion</a></li>

<li><a href="#nav">LaTeX Navigator</a></li>

<h2>Project Management</h2>

<P>A main file can be specified either globally or locally. The global setting is done through the plugin menu, where <em>Set Main File</em> sets the global main file to the current file, and <em>Reset Main File</em> removes the global property. The local setting is achieved by adding somewhere in the first 5 lines of the file the string <CODE>:latex.root=<em>Absolute or relative path to Main file</em>:</CODE>. The menu command <em>Show Main File</em> displays the path to the main file in a pop up box. Note that if present, the locally defined Main file has priority, followed by the globally defined property. If no global property has been set, then the current buffer is deemed to be the Main file.
</P>

<P>The main file is used by several other commands, such as the two <em>Compile</em> commands, the <em>BiBTex</em>  command and the <em>Erase Working Files...</em> command. It is also used by the Label Navigator and the BibTeX Navigator in order to correctly parse information. <em>The project files</em> is a term used in these instructions to refer to the set of files that include the Main file and all files imported by files in the set.
</P>

 
<a name="commands"></a>

<h2>Useful Commands</h2>

Various utility commands are included, accessible through the Plugins menu. These are catagorized as follows:

<h3>Navigation</h3>

<p>The commands <em>BibTeX Navigator</em>, <em>Label Navigator</em> and <em>Structure Browser</em>   simply open the relevant navigation windows. <em>Display Image</em> looks under the caret to see if a graphics object is present. If it is, then it tries to display the image in a (dockable) window.
</p>

<p>
<em>Open Main File</em> simply opens the Main file as the current buffer. 
<em>Open Import</em> looks to see if there is an import statement under the caret, and if so tries to open the import file.
</p>

<h3>Compilation</h3>

There are four commands here. <em>Compile</em> runs the default compilation command on the current buffer using the Console plugin. The <em>Compile...</em> command allows the user to specify the compilation command in a text box (which maintains a history of commands). <em>BibTeX</em> runs BibTeX on the current buffer, again through the Console. <em>Erase Working Files...</em> displays a checkbox list of file extensions, and deletes all files in the same directory as the Main file with those extensions (giving plenty of opportunity to pull out at the last minute!).

<h3>Project Management</h3>

These are the commands <em>Set Main File</em>, <em>Reset Main File</em> and  <em>Show Main File Path</em>. These are described in <a href="#project">Project Management</a> above. 

<h3>Text Insertion</h3>

These are various shortcuts to manipulate text. They are pretty self explanatory so play around...

<a name="bibtex"></a>

<h2>BibTeX Completion</h2>

<p>This tool searches the project files for a <code>\begin{thebibliography}</code>
environment, or  a
<code>\bibliography{}</code> command. If the former is found, the
current file is searched for <code>\bibitem</code> commands, and
compiles a list of such entries. If the latter is found, then all
referenced bib files are searched for the reference names and
reference titles, and a table compiled containing these.</p>

<p>A dialog is displayed, from which a selection (or selections
if the ALT or CTRL keys are held down whilst clicking on table
entries) can be made. Once ENTER is pressed, all entries are
entered at the cursor position in the current buffer as a comma
delimited list. The dialog is cancelled by pressing ESCAPE, by
closing the dialog window, or by hitting ENTER with no selections
made.</p>

<h3>Options</h3>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Include Tag. If this is selected, then the string \cite{ and }
are inserted around the citations on enter.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Maximum Letters in Title. The integer value gives the maximum
number of letters per word in the title. If set to 0, the title
is left intact. For example, if the value is set to 3, then
&quot;The Users Guide to jEdit&quot; is abbreviated to &quot;The
Use Gui to jEd&quot;.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Maximum Words in Title. The integer value gives the maximum
number of words in the title. For example, if the value is set to
3, then &quot;The Users Guide to jEdit&quot; is abbreviated to
&quot;The Users Guide&quot;.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<a name="label"></a>

<h2>Reference Completion</h2>

<p>When activated, this tool simply searches the project files
for <code>\label{}</code> commands, and displays the results in a
dialog. Only single label can be selected (multiple
references in a single <code>\ref</code> are not supported in
LaTeX as they are in <code>\cite</code> commands).</p>

<p>
Clicking a label has the following effects:

<ul>
<li><strong>Single Click</strong>: scrolls to the label in the appropriate buffer. Note that this may change the current buffer.</li>
<li><strong>Double Click</strong>: inserts a reference to the label at the cursor position in the current buffer.</li>
<li><strong>ALT-Click</strong>: "locks" the insertion point for the reference to the cursor position of the current buffer, and then acts like the Single Click above. The lock is released when a click is performed without the ALT key and when the mouse leaves the navigator window.</li>
</ul>

The ALT-Click locking mechanism allows the entire list of labels to be explored by keeping ALT held down and clicking the labels to view their positions. Double clicking a reference (with or without the ALT key) will insert the reference at the saved cursor location.
</p>

<h3>Options</h3>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Include Tag. If this is selected, then the string \ref{ and }
are inserted around the citations on enter.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<a name="nav"></a>

<h2>LaTeX Navigator</h2>

<p>This feature implements a document navigator. By default all special
elements of the document are displayed in the SideKick structure browser.
A separate (dockable) dialog has controls for selecting the document
elements to parse - a few are predefined, but user defined lists can add to
or replace these, as described below.
</p>

<h3>Suggested use.</h3>

The way I use the document navigator is to have the Structure Browser docked to the right, and the Navigation Toolbar docked at the top (it is one line deep, so doesn't take much space). This way it is easy to select the features of the document you wish to see. If you simply want all of the main elements displayed, don't bother with the toolbar - it is the default parser.

<h3>User defined Navigation Lists.</h3>

<p>User defined navigation lists are text files containing search
data for parsing the document, and are placed in the directory
specified in the Global Options for the LaTeX Navigator. They
have the following syntax:</p>

<p>Navigation lists must have a title as the first line of the
list, of the format, &quot;@<i>title</i><b>n</b>&quot;.
<i>title</i> is the name displayed in the combo box; <b>n</b> is
a single digit, giving the preferred position in the combo box (1
being the top, 9 being the bottom) or 0 if it should not appear
at all. Users can override default lists by adding a new list of
the same name to a user list - user lists take precedent over the
defaults.</p>

<p>Following the title tag are the lines defining the search
strings to look for in the text. These must be of the format,
&quot;<strong>N:search string:replace string:I</strong> &quot;. where <strong>N</strong>  is the nesting level of the search string, and <strong>I</strong>  is the icon to use in the sidekick tree.
</p>
<p>
 The <strong>search string</strong>  is parsed as a regular expression (so if simple definitions are required, remember to escape special characters). </p>
 <p>
 The <strong>replace string</strong>  is an ordinary string, but the strings $1, $2, etc can be used to refer to captured groups in the search string. If the replace string is simply a "&nbsp;" (space) character, then any captured groups are concatenated and used as the text in the tree, or if no capturing groups are present, then the whole found string (group $0) is used as the tree text. Either a replace expression, or single space should be used as the replace string - other strings may have unpredictable results. Note also that if the ':' symbol is required in either search or replace string, the unicode escape \u003A should be used, or the navigation item will not be parsed correctly. An
example from the default navigation file follows:</p>

<br>

<div style="padding-left:4em;background:#dddddd">
<pre>
@Sections2
1:\\chapter\{(.+?)\}: :1
2:\\section\{(.+?)\}: :1
3:\\subsection\{(.+?)\}: :1
4:\\subsubsection\{(.+?)\}: :1
5:\\paragraph\{(.+?)\}: :1

@Theorems4
1:\\begin\{theorem\}(\[.+?\])?:Thm\u003A $1:3
1:\\begin\{lemma\}(\[.+?\])?:Lem\u003A $1:3
1:\\begin\{proposition\}(\[.+?\])?:Prp\u003A $1:3
1:\\begin\{definition\}(\[.+?\])?:Dfn\u003A $1:3
1:\\begin\{corollary\}(\[.+?\])?:Cor\u003A $1:3
2:\\begin\{proof\}(\[.+?\])?:Proof\u003A $1:0

</pre>
</div>
<p>
Note that the Sections group in this example will only print the section title in the tree. The strings "Thm" etc will be displayed in the case of the Theorems group, along with the description if present.
</p>

<p>The integers for various icons are as follows:</p>

<table width="50%">
<tr>
<td><img alt="default" src="images/default.png"></td><td>Default</td><td>0</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img alt="section" src="images/sections.png"></td><td>Section</td><td>1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img alt="graphics" src="images/graphics.png"></td><td>Graphics</td><td>2</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img alt="theorem" src="images/theorem.png"></td><td>Theorem</td><td>3</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img alt="table" src="images/table.png"></td><td>Table</td><td>4</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img alt="list" src="images/list.png"></td><td>List</td><td>5</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img alt="list" src="images/verbatim.png"></td><td>Verbatim</td><td>6</td>
</tr>
</table>
Any other integer value will display no image at all.
