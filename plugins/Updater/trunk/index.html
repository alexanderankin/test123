<h2>Description</h2>
This plugin automates updates to jEdit. It checks if a new version is available
for download, then downloads it and launches the installer of the new version.<br>
You can select one of the following sources for updates:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://jedit.org/index.php?page=download">Latest version (development)</a><br>
This is the latest <b>released</b> version, e.g. 4.3pre17.
It is not the latest development version from SVN.
<li><a href="http://www.tellurianring.com/projects/jedit-daily/index.php?dir=jEdit%2F">Daily jEdit builds</a><br>
Each build contains the latest version from SVN (at the time the build is
created).<br>
The daily builds are contributed by Eric Berry. Thanks Eric!
</ul>
<h2>Options</h2>
The plugin option pane contains the following options:
<ul>
<li>Log file for jEdit update messages. The log file is accumulative; it is
never cleared automatically, and each update appends its own messages to it.
<li>Source to use for automatic updates: Latest release or daily builds
(explained above).
<li>Triggers for automatic updates: On startup / Every 'n' days.
<li>Whether updates should be interactive. Interactive updates use the Java
GUI installer, which asks which components to install and where. Non-interactive
updates use the Java "headless" installer to install all components into the
current installation directory.
</ul>
<h2>Actions</h2>
Other than the automatic updates, the plugin provides actions (and menu items)
to update jEdit from one of the update sources described above whenever you like.
<h2>Update functionality</h2>
When an update starts running, it opens a window with a text pane for messages
and two buttons, 'ok' and 'cancel'. The text pane shows the update progress.
The 'ok' button is disabled until the update is over, after which it will simply
close the window. The 'cancel' button may be used to cancel the update before
the installer is launched. Once the installer starts running, the 'cancel'
button will be disabled. Canceling the installer can only be done if the GUI
installer is used, and is done using the installer's 'cancel' button. The
non-interactive installer cannot be cancelled.<br>
The update process begins by checking if a version newer than the current is
available for download. If a newer version is not available, the update ends,
and the text pane shows messages specifying the current version and the latest
available version.<br> 
If a new version is available, it is downloaded, and then the Java installer is
launched to install it (according to the options described above).<br>
The entire update process runs in the background. You can continue working with
jEdit while the plugin checks for a new version and downloads it. Once the
installer is launched, it instructs jEdit to exit (using the jEdit server
interface) before installing the new version. Finally, when the new version is
installed, you can close the update window and start the new version of jEdit.
