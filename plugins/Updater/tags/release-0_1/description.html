The Updater plugin automates updates to jEdit. It can update to the latest
released version (e.g. 4.3pre17) or to the latest daily build. You can configure
the plugin to run automatically on startup, or once in a few days when jEdit
is running. It also offers an action to manually trigger an update.
When updating, it shuts down jEdit, and you need to manually restart it when
the installer is done.
