		<para>
			The Text Filter plugin allows you to use text from a jEdit buffer as
			input to an external process, and capture the process' output into
			a jEdit buffer.
		</para>

	<chapter id="usage">
		<title>Using the Text Filter plugin</title>

		<para>
			There are two main ways to use the plugin: running a filter once, or
			creating a filter that will be stored in the plugin's configuration
			file.
		</para>

		<para>
			To run a filter once, choose the "Run filter" option from the
			plugin's menu (under jEdit's Plugins menu). To create a new
			filter, choose the "Create new filter" option. The "Remove filter"
			option allows you to delete one of the created filters.
		</para>

		<para>
			The only limitation is that the name of the filters cannot have the
			"," (comma) character.
		</para>

		<para>
			To substitute and existing filter, just create a new filter and give
			it the same name as an existing one. You'll be promped for whether
			you want to overwrite the existing filter.
		</para>

		<para>
			Below, the several options available for the filter are explained.
		</para>

		<bridgehead renderas='sect3'>Data source type</bridgehead>

		<para>
			These options control from where the external process expects to
			collect the data that Text Filter will provide.
		</para>

		<itemizedlist>
			<listitem>
				<para>
					<emphasis>Standard IN</emphasis>: the text will be passed
					to the external process via the standard input. The most
					common form of transfer, used by most UNIX utilities.
				</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>
					<emphasis>Argument</emphasis>: the text will be passed
					to the external process as an argument line. If the text
					contains more than one word, this will mean the external
					process will receive more than one argument.
				</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>
					<emphasis>String</emphasis>: the text will be passed
					to the external process as a string. This means that the
					text will be escaped and surrounded by quotes, and the
					external process will see all the text as a single argument.
				</para>
			</listitem>
		</itemizedlist>

		<para>
			When choosing something other than "standard in", be aware that if
			the process being called expect input though stdin, it will hang
			waiting for input, and jEdit will be unusable until you kill the
			offending process.
		</para>

		<bridgehead renderas='sect3'>Text source</bridgehead>

		<para>
			This option tells Text Filter where to look for the text to pass
			to the external process.
		</para>

		<itemizedlist>
			<listitem>
				<para>
					<emphasis>Buffer</emphasis>: use all the content of the
					buffer as input to the external process.
				</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>
					<emphasis>Selection</emphasis>: use the current selection
					as input. Will generate an error in case nothing is
					selected.
				</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>
					<emphasis>None</emphasis>: will call the external process
					without providing any other information that that present
					in the given command line. The same warning about processes
					that expect input from stdin applies here.
				</para>
			</listitem>
		</itemizedlist>

		<bridgehead renderas='sect3'>Destination</bridgehead>

		<para>
			This option controls what will be done with the output of the
			process once the external program finishes its execution.
		</para>

		<itemizedlist>
			<listitem>
				<para>
					<emphasis>New Buffer</emphasis>: creates a new jEdit buffer
					and appends the output of the process to it.
				</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>
					<emphasis>Selection</emphasis>: substitues the current
					selection with the output from the process. If no selection
					exists, the output is appended to the current caret
					position.
				</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>
					<emphasis>Append</emphasis>: the output of the process is
					appended to the end of the active buffer.
				</para>
			</listitem>
		</itemizedlist>

		<para>
			When executing external processes, errors may occur. In case any
			errors are seen on stderr, a dialog is shown with the error output
			and you are given the option to discard any output the process has
			generated, or process the output anyway.
		</para>
