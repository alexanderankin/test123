Substance 6.1 readme

The Substance project had a bad set back. They were being hosted at dev.java.net and their files were not migrated as they should have been during a site reorganization. Kirill (the Substance author) posted the last files he had on his website at git-hub, and the files in this directory are some of those. What I have here are enough to build the basic Substance jars necessary to complete the plugin for jEdit. Unfortunately, Kirill doesn't have time to sort out the mess from dev.java.net and has essentially abandoned the project for now.
