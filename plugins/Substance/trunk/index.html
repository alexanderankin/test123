        <h2>Substance Look and Feel</h2>

        <p>This plugin provides the Substance Look and Feel to
        jEdit.</p>
        
        <h3>Configuration</h3>
        <p>
        <b>All configuration for this plugin is done in the Look and Feel
        plugin.</b> Look in Plugins - Plugin Options - Look And Feel, then select "Substance" 
        from the Look and Feel dropdown. You will have the option to choose from
        28 different themes. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
        Just below the 'Theme' dropdown is a checkbox for a new option for 
        Substance 7.3. It now has the ability to show a menu search button
        on the main jEdit menu bar. If selected, a magnifying glass icon will be
        displayed just to the right of the 'Help' menu. Click the icon, and a text
        field will be shown to enter some letters. Hit 'Enter' and you'll get one-click
        jumps to the menu items containing those letters. Ctrl+click on the magnifying
        glass will remove it from the menu bar. To put it back, just go to Plugin -
        Plugin Options - Look And Feel, make sure the checkbox is still checked, and
        click the 'OK' button.
        </p>
