        <h2>Substance Look and Feel</h2>

        <p>This plugin provides the Substance Look and Feel to
        jEdit.</p>

        <p>The website for Substance used to be at <a
        href="https://substance.dev.java.net/">https://substance.dev.java.net/</a>.</p>

        <p>The Substance project had a bad set back. They were
        being hosted at dev.java.net and their files were not
        migrated as they should have been during a site
        reorganization. Kirill (the Substance author) posted the
        last files he had on his website at git-hub, and the
        files in this directory are some of those. What I have
        here are enough to build the basic Substance jars
        necessary to complete the plugin for jEdit.
        Unfortunately, Kirill doesn't have time to sort out the
        mess from dev.java.net and has essentially abandoned the
        project for now.</p>
