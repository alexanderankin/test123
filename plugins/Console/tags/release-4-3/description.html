<p>The Console plugin provides you with two command-line shells, one for the System and one for Beanshell.
It also provides an interface for other plugins to add arbitrary shells to the Console plugin. </p>
<p> Console will parse error messages from other programs and feed them to the ErrorList plugin. </p>
<p> In addition, Console provides buttons in a "commando toolbar" for your favorite command-line tools (make, ant, qmake, latex, etc), and an easy way to add others.
</p>
<p> Console has special "compile" and "run" actions, which can be mapped to a single shortcut. The actions can perform a different commando action from each edit mode.
