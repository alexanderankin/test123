<h3>Version 3.0</h3>

Requires jEdit 3.2pre9, EditBus 1.0.1, and ErrorList 1.1. Many parts of the
plugin have been rewritten and expanded. Here is a partial list of major changes:

<ul>
<li>Compatibility fixes for jEdit 3.2
<li>Now loads a BeanShell code snippet on startup,
with <code>runCommandInConsole()</code>
and <code>runCommandInConsoleToBuffer()</code>
methods for macros
<li>Shell interface changed; you will need to install a new version of the
JCompiler plugin if you use it
<li>The current directory is now set on a per-console, rather than global, basis
<li>Each console can run its own process. Processes can also be started in
the background (ie, with no associated console)
by appending "&amp;" to the command string
<li>Process output can now be redirected to a buffer
<li>Long lines in command output no longer cause problems and slow everything
down (Dirk Moebius)
<li>'Console to Front' action added, it displays the console if not already open
and sets keyboard focus to the input text field. Replaces 'Go to Console' macro
in jEdit
<li>'Run Last Command' action added, it runs the most recently run command.
Replaces 'Run Last Command' macro in jEdit.
<li>The console now uses the text area font
<li>Error patterns are now stored in a more reliable manner
<li>Environment variables can be changed with %set, %unset, built-ins; run
%env to see a list
<li>On Unix and Windows, environment variables are obtained using system-specific
means and passed to child processes
</ul>
