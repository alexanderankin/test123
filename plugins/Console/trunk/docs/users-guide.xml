 <chapter id="setup">
 <title> Setup/Options </title>

 <para> Console has an optional dependency on ProjectViewer.
 What this means is that it has some extra features which you can see if you have also installed ProjectViewer plugin. In particular they are: </para>

 <orderedlist>
 <listitem><para> The ability to listen to node change events from the projectviewer and make changes to the System shell's current directory. </para></listitem>

 <listitem><para> The ability to query the ProjectViewer for the "current root directory" to run build commands from. This is used by the Console commandos for "ant", "make", and "qmake", and perhaps others<footnote><para> If you wish to use these commando buttons without the projectviewer, right click on the commando buttons, "customize" and edit the XML file, removing the lines that refer to projectviewer. </para></footnote>. </para></listitem>
</orderedlist>

 <bridgehead> Option Panes </bridgehead>

 <para> By selecting <literal>Plugin Options - Console </literal>, you will notice a number of options. It is recommended you browse through them to get a full idea of what Console (and your other plugins) can do.
 </para>

 <bridgehead> Console - General Options </bridgehead>

  <para> Here, you can set general options that apply to all shells, such as showing the welcome message, character encoding to use, scrollback buffer size, colors, etc. </para>

 <itemizedlist>
  <listitem><para><emphasis>Show Welcome Message</emphasis> - suppress welcome message on shells. </para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem><para><emphasis>Character Encoding</emphasis> - If you want to
  display characters in a different language, change the encoding here.
  </para></listitem>
 </itemizedlist>

 <bridgehead> Console - System Shell Options </bridgehead>

 <itemizedlist>
 <listitem>
	 <para> <emphasis>Shell Prefix </emphasis> - This string is inserted before the command you type whenever a command is executed. Console itself does parse and preprocess your commands in its own way, but you have the option of having the commands subsequently evaluated by your native command line shell, which will in turn execute your command.
     </para>

     <para> Console can choose a sensible os-specific shell prefix for you, by setting it to <literal>osdefault</literal>. If this field is blank, or if <literal>none</literal> is used, Console will execute commands directly (without a prefix).
     I prefer using a native shell for its functions, aliases, and redirection, but you can try different values here to see which works best for you.
     </para>

     <para> In addition, if you like to use a different shell from the OS-default (4NT, or cygwin's bash), you can add it to this list and see if it works. </para>

  </listitem>

  <listitem>
	  <para>
		<emphasis>Merge stdout and stderr</emphasis> - this option will only affect users of "make", where Console needs to merge the streams in order to resolve pathnames of files of errors inbetween "make entering..leaving" messages.
	  </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem><para><emphasis>Subshell extra PATH</emphasis> - This option
		  prepends directories to the environment before spawning
		  subprocesses. If you want your jedit console to be able to find some files in the path, add those directories here.
	  </para></listitem>
  <listitem><para><emphasis>Append extra dirs to PATH</emphasis> - if
        checked, append instead of prepend the extra directories.
  </para></listitem>



 </itemizedlist>

 <section id="errorpatterns">
 <title> Error Patterns Options </title>

 <para> This option dialog allows you fine grained control over Console's error parsing capabilities.
 </para>

 <para> Each line of output that is generated by a program that is run in the Console <literal>System</literal> (and <literal>ssh</literal>) shells is checked against a number of error patterns to determine if the line is part of an error message. If the error message is found, pieces of information are extracted from it to get the line number and filename. This information is in turn fed into Error List to give you a convenient way to send the editor to the location of an error message. </para>

<para> Each error pattern is a set of regular expressions. To edit, test, add, or remove error patterns from Console's output parsing module, you can select this option dialog. Keep in mind, you must "test/commit" each error pattern before clicking 'ok'. This helps avoid accidentally committing invalid regular expressions that may cause parse errors.
</para>

<tip>
<title> Removing unused patterns. </title>

<para> Since many of the error patterns are similar, it is possible that one of the existing patterns is getting triggered before Console sees the one you are developing. For this reason, it is suggested you remove or disable the error patterns you are not using, and place the error patterns for the tools you use most often at the top of the list.
</para>
</tip>

 <chapter id="window">
  <title>The console window</title>

 <para> <guimenu>Plugins</guimenu> -&gt; <guisubmenu>Console</guisubmenu> -&gt; <guimenuitem>Console</guimenuitem> displays the console window. This window is floating by default, but can be  made to dock into the view in the <guilabel>Docking</guilabel> pane of the  <guimenuitem>Global Options</guimenuitem> dialog box.
 </para>

  <para>
 The console window consists of a popup for choosing the current  <firstterm>shell</firstterm>, a series of icon buttons, and a shell input/output area that occupies the remaining space of the window.
 </para>

 <para>
 The Console plugin allows arbitrary
 shells to be plugged in; one shell included with the plugin
 is called the <quote>System</quote> shell and it runs external programs and
 commands; another built-in shell is the <quote>BeanShell</quote> shell,
 which runs commands in jEdit's BeanShell interpreter. Some plugins add
 their own shells; for example, the <application>SshConsole</application>
 plugin adds a shell for running shell commands remotely over <command>ssh</command>.
 without leaving jEdit.
 </para>

 <para>
 Each button shows a tooltip if the mouse pointer is held over it long enough.
 Here is a description of each button:
 </para>

  <itemizedlist>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     <guibutton>Run last command</guibutton> - runs the
 most recently entered command.</para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     <guibutton>Run</guibutton> - runs the currently-entered command.
 This has the same effect as pressing <keycap>Enter</keycap> in the text field.
 </para>
   </listitem>

   <listitem>
    <para>
     <guibutton>Run to buffer</guibutton> - runs the
 currently-entered command, but shows the output in a new buffer, instead of in the console window. This has the same effect as pressing <keycap>Ctrl-Enter</keycap> from the text field. </para>
   </listitem>

   <listitem>
    <para>
     <guibutton>Stop</guibutton> - stops the currently running process, if any.</para>
   </listitem>

   <listitem>
    <para>
     <guibutton>Clear</guibutton> - clears the console window's
 output area.</para>
   </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>

  <tip>
   <para>
  A quick way to switch between shells from the keyboard is by entering the
  shell name prefixed with <quote>:</quote>. For example,
  <quote>:BeanShell</quote> or <quote>:System</quote>. In addition, each shell has its own toggle and switch shortcut defined from <guimenuitem>Global Options - Shortcuts - Plugin: Console - Shell Switchers </guimenuitem>.
 </para>
  </tip>

 </chapter>

 <chapter id="system-shell">
  <title>The system shell</title>
  <para>
 This section assumes at least basic familiarity with the command-line
 interpreter of a Unix, Windows or similar operating system.
</para>

  <para>
 As with most other command lines, spaces are used to separate
 command-line parameters to programs. If a string containing
 spaces needs to be passed as a single parameter, it should be enclosed with
 double quotes (<userinput>"</userinput>), for example:
</para>

  <screen>javac "C:\Source Code\TestServlet.java"</screen>

  <para>
 Not all commands result in an external process being spawned; the system
 shell supports <quote>built-ins</quote>, which are handled by the
 Console plugin itself. Built-ins are prefixed with <quote>%</quote> to
 distinguish them from external commands.
</para>

  <para>
 Currently selected text is passed to the program on standard input. In
 conjunction with the <guibutton>Run to buffer</guibutton> button, this
 allows quick filtering of buffer text using shell tools.
</para>

  <para>
 Pressing <keycap>Tab</keycap> in the console's command input field will
 attempt to complete the filename or command before the caret. If there is more than
 one possible completion, they will be listed in the output area.
</para>

  <para> Processes that read from standard input might work. You can press
	<keycombo><keycap>Control</keycap>
    <keycap>D</keycap>
   </keycombo> to send an end-of-file. Note that since the plugin does not provide a pseudo-terminal, so some
	programs, such as shells that use getline() or curses(), might not behave properly inside
	a console window. </para>

  <sect1 id="error-parsing">
   <title>Error parsing</title>

   <para>
  Each line of output produced by an external program is fed through several
  successive <literal>ErrorMatcher</literal> objects. Each
  <literal>ErrorMatcher</literal>
  corresponds to a different style of error messages, and holds
  onto an three <firstterm>regular expressions</firstterm> - for
  errors, warnings, and extra lines. </para>

  <para> The order of patterns on this list matters: more specific
  patterns should be earlier on the list.
  Patterns for applications you do not use can be safely removed from
  this list, and this can speed things up during output parsing. </para>

  <para>
  If the output of a line matches the error
  pattern, then file name, line number and error
  message are extracted from it; if not, the line is then optionally
  matched against another regular expression to determine if it is a
  warning.
 </para>

   <para>
  If an error pattern specifies a filename of <quote>$f</quote>, the current
  buffer's path is used; otherwise, the filename is resolved relative to the
  current directory.
 </para>

   <para>
  It is also possible to specify an <quote>extra</quote> regular expression,
  against which lines subsequent to an error or warning are checked and added to the
  message if there is a match.
  This can be used to handle compilers which
  produce compiler errors and warnings that span several lines.
  For this pattern, the string to be appended to the error message must be in a back-reference (round braces).
   </para>

   <para>
  Parsed error and warning messages are shown in the
  <guimenu>Plugins</guimenu>&gt;<guisubmenu>Error
  List</guisubmenu>&gt;<guimenuitem>Error List</guimenuitem> window; this
  window is used to display errors from several other plugins as well.
 </para>

   <para>
  The Console plugin includes error patterns that match errors produced
  by the following tools:
 </para>

   <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
     <para>Generic errors matching the following format, produced by many
  tools, including javac and gcc:</para>
     <screen>
      <replaceable>file</replaceable>:<replaceable>line</replaceable>:<replaceable>message</replaceable>
     </screen>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>Generic errors matching the so called
  <quote>Emacs</quote> format:</para>

      <replaceable>file</replaceable>:<replaceable>start line</replaceable>:<replaceable>end line</replaceable>:<replaceable>start column</replaceable>:<replaceable>end column</replaceable>:<replaceable>message</replaceable>
     </screen>
     <para>
   The <command>jikes</command> Java compiler will produce errors in this
   form if given if the <command>+E</command> command-line option. Otherwise,
   it will output errors in a non-standard format which cannot be parsed by
   the Console plugin.
  </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem> <para>Errors output by the <command>javac</command> compiler
  found in
  Java 2 version 1.3 and later. Earlier versions are also supported, because
  they output errors in the generic format documented above.</para></listitem>

  Error patterns can be customized in the

   <title>Changing directories</title>

   <para>
 To change the current working directory, simply enter its name, as if you were
 going to execute a command. Relative paths are resolved
 automatically.
</para>

   <para>
 The following system shell built-ins relate to the current working directory:
</para>

   <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      <command>pwd</command> - prints the current working

 lines.</para>
    </listitem>

    </listitem>
   </itemizedlist>

  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="process-manage">
   <title>Process management</title>

   <para>
  Each console window has an associated <quote>foreground process</quote>;
  output produced by the foreground process is shown in that console
  window. Starting a new process while one is already running in the
  foreground will terminate the existing process.
 </para>
   <para>
  The <command>%kill</command> built-in can also be used to
  terminate the currently running foreground process. Clicking the
  <guibutton>Stop</guibutton> button in the console window has the same
  effect.
 </para>
   <para>
  A process can be started in the <quote>background</quote> by adding
  <quote>&amp;</quote> to the end of its command line. After a process is
  started in the background, it continues running until it exits. Output is
  not shown in the console window, and starting other processes has no effect on
  already-running background processes.
 </para>

   <para>
 Pressing <keycombo><keycap>Control</keycap>
     <keycap>Z</keycap>
    </keycombo>
 detaches the foreground process. In the System shell, the process continues
 running in the background, and no longer shows output in the console, which
 is not very *nix-like, but oh well.
</para>

  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="env-vars">
   <title>Environment variables</title>

   <para>
 When running on Unix and Windows NT/2000/XP, the system shell lets you access
 and change
 operating system-specific environment variables. On other systems, you can
 define and use variables, but they are console-specific.
</para>

   <para>
 To accommodate both Windows and Unix users, three forms of variable syntax are
 supported by the system shell:
</para>

   <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      <varname>%<replaceable>name</replaceable>%</varname>

 The following variables are defined under all circumstances, independent
 of operating system-specific environment variables being available or not:
</para>

   <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
     <para>

 <classname>org.gjt.sp.jedit.jEdit</classname> and it is contained in the
 <filename>/home/slava/jEdit/org/gjt/sp/jedit/</filename> directory, this will
 return <filename>/home/slava/jEdit/</filename>.
 </para>

  <sect1 id="commando-window">
   <title>The Commando window</title>

   <para>
 The commando window consists of a combo box for selecting a commando file,
 and two tabs; the first contains GUI controls for specifying command-line
 settings, the second shows the resulting command line (or command lines,
 if the commando file defines more than one command to be run).
</para>

   <para>
 Currently, settings specified in the commando window are remembered for
 the duration of the current jEdit session. In the future, integration
 with a project management plugin will be provided, for specifying command
 line tool settings on a per-project basis.
</para>

   <para>
 One you have configured the necessary settings, click <guibutton>OK</guibutton>
 to run each command specified in the commando file in turn. Most commando
 files will only specify one command to run.
</para>

   <para>
 Some commands will
 be executed automatically, others will ask for confirmation; if a command
 fails, you will always be asked for confirmation before running the next one,
 no matter what. Some commando files, such as the <filename>diff</filename>
 file included with the Console plugin, show their output in a new buffer,
 rather than the console window.
</para>

 <chapter id="svngit">
 <title> Using Console with svn or git </title>

 <para> When you commit via the command line versions of <literal>git</literal> or <literal>svn</literal>, the tool spawns an external editor for you to enter text with the commit log. The editor that is spawned can be specified by the <literal>VISUAL</literal> (for svn) or <literal>EDITOR</literal> (for git) environment variables. When the editor starts, you are editing a temporary file. When the editor sub-process exits, the commit tool retrieves the temporary file's contents. </para>

 <para> A batch file or shellscript that runs jEdit can be used as the <literal>VISUAL</literal> and <literal>EDITOR</literal> that is called by command line programs like <literal>git</literal> and <literal>svn</literal>, even when run from inside jEdit's Console plugin. Here are some command line options that you should consider passing jEdit when it is started by another program such as svn:
 </para>

 <itemizedlist>
 <listitem><para> <literal>-wait</literal> - waits until the buffer is closed before allowing the spawning process to 'exit' - this way you don't have to exit the main jEdit process when you are ready to commit. </para></listitem>
 <listitem><para> <literal>-noplugins</literal> - if this is a new view (jedit is not already running), don't load all the plugins. </para></listitem>
 <listitem><para> <literal>-norestore</literal> - don't restore the previously open files. </para></listitem>
 <listitem><para> <literal>-newplainview</literal> - open a new window (if jEdit is already running). Some people might prefer <literal>-reuseview</literal> here, depending on the expected behavior of your previous editor. </para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

 <para> So I have a shell script called <literal>jeditcommit</literal> that looks like this: </para>
<programlisting>
exec java -jar "$JEDIT_HOME/jedit.jar" -wait -noplugins -reuseview -norestore $@
</programlisting>
<para> And I have a windows batch file called <literal>jeditcommit.bat</literal> that looks like this: </para>
<programlisting>
javaw -jar "%JEDIT_HOME%\jedit.jar" -wait -norestore -noplugins -reuseview %*
</programlisting>

<para> I set my <literal>EDITOR</literal> and <literal>VISUAL</literal> to <literal>jeditcommit</literal>
from my regular jEdit startup script, so it is used only from jEdit. </para>

<para> In summary, if your batch file includes these options, you use it as the <literal>EDITOR</literal> when you commit from the regular command line, or from jEdit's console, and svn will wait until you close the buffer before sending the log message and your changes to the repository.
</para>

 <chapter id="extending">
  <title>Extending the Console plugin</title>

  <para>
    To add a shell to the console, a plugin must specify that
	it requires the Console plugin, and register a
 	<ulink url="javadoc/console/Shell.html">Shell</ulink> implementation in the plugin's <filename>services.xml</filename> file.
</para>

  <sect1 id="specifying-dependencies">
   <title>Specifying dependencies</title>

   <para>
  In order to give the user a helpful error message if the Console
  plugin is not installed, your plugin should specify dependency properties.
  If your plugin's core class is named <classname>MyPlugin</classname>, the
  corresponding dependencies might look like so:
 </para>

   <programlisting>plugin.MyPlugin.depend.0=jedit 04.02.99.00
plugin.MyPlugin.depend.2=plugin console.ConsolePlugin 4.2</programlisting>

   <para>
  Note that the current version of the Console plugin requires jEdit 4.2 final
  or later, so your plugin should also require at least that jEdit version.
  If a newer version of the Console plugin is available, you can
  specify higher version numbers than in the example above. However, all the
  API calls in this chapter are guaranteed to work with the above version,
  so in most cases you shouldn't worry about it.

   <bridgehead> Where does the Output come from? </bridgehead>

   <para> The <classname>Console</classname> maintains a <varname>shellStateMap</varname>, a 1:1 mapping of shell names to <classname>Console.ShellState</classname> instances.  <classname>Console.ShellState</classname> is a concrete instance of <classname>Output</classname> which stores the Console's scrollback buffer.

   <para>
   When you call <function>console.setShell(String name)</function>, the <varname>shellState</varname> for that shell is automatically created and set. If you need an Output instance for a specific shell, from another part of your plugin, you can call <function>console.getOutput()</function> immediately after <function>console.setShell()</function>.

 Most plugin shells will need to report compiler errors and such. To do this, you will first need to create and register an <classname>ErrorSource</classname>;
 see the <application>ErrorList</application> plugin documentation for details. You will also need to add the errors to the error source at some stage. There are two ways of doing this:
