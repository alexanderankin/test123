        Rebuilt against 4.3pre13 for binary compatibility
        getProjectRoot directory more robust from make.xml, ant.xml and

        alias ant ant -emacs to get rid of adornments when running inside System
        shell (ezust).
        Improved generic extra line regexp - catches javac and gcc multilines
        better. Made #1 on list. (ezust).
        (windows only) - driveletters work in Console the way they do in
        cmd.exe, as change-directory shortcuts. Console keeps track of default
        directories for each drive, as well as the default drive for the current
        shell session. Also, / works as well as \ for path separators. (Alan
        Ezust - bug#1511941 )
        Small changes to make the SshConsole plugin work (ezust).

    ProjectViewer 2.1.1 (optional)

        (1665849) PV CD to selected node no longer requires system shell to be
        active. (Alan Ezust)

    Version 4.3.0 Requires jEdit 4.3pre7, JDK 1.5, ErrorList 1.3.5, and
    ProjectViewer 2.1.1 (optional)

        New dynamic ActionSet (Plugin: Console - Shell Switchers) generated for
        switching to, or toggling the Console, combined with selecting a
        specific shell. In other words, now you can bind a specific keyboard
        shortcut to "Toggle Beanshell" and another for "Show Ant Shell", etc.
        (Alan Ezust)

    Version 4.2.6.5 Requires jEdit 4.2 final, JDK 1.5, ErrorList 1.3.5, and

        documented.
        For bash prefix mode, fixed some quote handling bugs.

    Version 4.2.6.1 Requires jEdit 4.2 final, JDK 1.5, ErrorList 1.3.5, and
    ProjectViewer 2.1.1 (optional) (Alan Ezust)

        Improved make and ant commando buttons (They grab ProjectViewer's root dir).
        Fixed *nix quoting/spacing/platform issues (1468934).
        Fixed 1459562 - Console.waitFor() now works.
        Added checkboxes in General Option Pane: showExitStatus and mergeStreams.
        Added "none" option for shell prefix (which currently does not work).

    Version 4.2.6 Requires jEdit 4.2 final, JDK 1.5, ErrorList 1.3.5, and
    ProjectViewer 2.1.1 (optional)

        Generic error pattern handles windows pathnames now.

        Rewrote variable substitution code. (Ezust)
        Merging stdout/stderr of subprocesses is optional and works now. (Ezust)

    Version 4.2.5.1 Requires jEdit 4.2 final, JDK 1.5, ErrorList 1.3.5, and
    ProjectViewer 2.1.1 (optional) (Alan Ezust)

        Bugs fixed: 1460349 1459481 1459460 1454080 1449325 1448809

    Version 4.2.2 Requires jEdit 4.2 final, JDK 1.5, ErrorList 1.3.5,
    ProjectViewer 2.1.1 (optional) (Alan Ezust)

        Rewrote the Error Pattern dialog into a JPanel, embeddable in the larger
        OptionPane. No more popping up of dialogs for editing an error pattern.

        Now it is possible to enable/disable individual error matchers with a
        checkbox there.

    Version 4.2.1 Requires jEdit 4.2 final, ErrorList 1.3.5, and JDK 1.5.
    Optional: Projectviewer 2.1.0.92 (for listening to events) (Alan Ezust)

        Rewrote command execution part to use the JDK 1.5 ProcessBuilder class.
        This made it possible to merge stdout and stderr, which means that the
        output of make, which sends its "entering/leaving" messages to stdout,
        and its error messages to stderr, can be merged into one stream for
        parsing.

        Context menu on commando buttons lets you hide/customize the built-in

        ProjectViewer root, and chdir to ProjectViewer current.
        Option to bind the above actions to new ProjectViewer Events.
        Console Preferences allow you to set a prefix, so you can run each
        command in an alternate shell (not working yet).

    Version 4.2 Requires jEdit 4.2 final, JDK 1.4, and ErrorList 1.3.5

        Possibility of testing regular expressions in the Plugin Options -
        Console - Error Patterns.
        Rewrote to use java.util.Pattern instead of gnu.regex.RE.
        Possibility of selecting which Commando buttons are shown in the toolbar.
        Added some more Commando buttons (make, ant) to choose from.
        Misc bugfixes - Alan Ezust

    Version 4.1.2 requires jEdit 4.2final, JDK 1.4, and ErrorList 1.3.1.

        Console caret color is now configurable (Justin Dieters).

    Version 4.1.1 requires jEdit 4.2final and the ErrorList plugin 1.3.1.

        Fixed race condition with command output to a buffer that could result
        in a NullPointerException.
        Commando dialog fields are saved, as long as they do not result from a
        computed evaluation (for example, path names are not saved because they
        are computed from the current buffer's name).
        Pressing Control+Z detaches the foreground process. The process
        continues running in the background, and no longer shows output in the
        console.

    Version 4.1 requires jEdit 4.2final and the ErrorList plugin 1.3.1.

        Minor change to EvalAction for Factor.
        Invoking %clear in the system shell would print the prompt twice.
        Passing a path name that is not a directory to %cd now prints an error.
        If running a command caused the current shell to be changed, output
        would still go to the old shell.
        Error parsing and copying of text from the console was broken on
        Windows, due to incorrect line terminator handling.
        Automatically check for files being changed on disk after a command
        completes.

    Version 4.0.1 requires jEdit 4.2final and the ErrorList plugin 1.3.1.

        Generic error pattern was broken.

    Version 4.0 requires jEdit 4.2final and the ErrorList plugin 1.3.1.

        The separate input field is now gone; all input is done in the console
        pane.
        The plugin can now send standard input to processes. Press Control+D to
        send an end-of-file.
        Unloading the Console plugin did not hide the Commando tool bar.
        Console tool bar is now gone, since the console input field component no
        longer exists.
        Fixed a minor flaw in the generic error pattern, add Python error
        pattern (Ollie Rutherfurd).
        If an error was raised by the BeanShell, opening the Console in
        subsequently-created views would fail because of a rogue variable that
        was set in the global namespace.
