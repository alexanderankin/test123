Version 3.5:

- a--viper's perl commando
- cvs commandos
- commando: text area
- console completion doesn't work w/ $BROWSER_DIR/foo

Later:

- periodic execution feature
- tool bar should be able to output to a buffer
- need <INIT> code block in commando files
- FILE_ENTRY, TOGGLE_ENTRY, more GUI controls in commando
- error hyperlinks
- stdin
- notify of process exit
- multiple-line env vars don't work
- see if an extra pattern can eat all javac errors
- TeX, Tidy error patterns
- foo"aaaa" doesn't parse like in a Unix shell
- command to copy a commando file to the user commando dir for easy
  customization
- beanshell completion
- aliases option pane
- globs (non-Windows only, Windows programs do their own glob expansion)
- hyperlinks in output; %ls output lines open files and directories;
  exception tracebacks handled, maybe
- URL hyperlinks.
- ${beanshell:...} syntax
- file manipulation builtins - %ls, %mv, %cp, %rm, %touch, %cat?
  - VFS support
  - cd to a non-local directory (don't allow running commands from non
    local dir, only built-ins)
- after jEdit API additions: tips of the day
- integration with project manager
- synchronize browser & console pwd (but make this toggle option)
- console tool bar: dir commands don't open console
- console tool bar: show status msg, regarding completion.
