+ version 3.2:

- need <INIT> code block in commando files
- java, javac, jikes commandos: package aware
- file name, built-in, alias completion
- finish documentation
- improve commando error handling
- 'compile' and 'run' commands:
  - need to make java and javac commandos easier to use
  - need more commandos: at least perl, python, ant, make, sh,
    latex/pdflatex, xdvi

+ later:

- keep browser dir and console dir in sync
- ${beanshell:...} syntax
- aliases option pane
- file manipulation builtins - %ls, %mv, %cp, %rm, %touch, %cat?
  - VFS support
  - cd to a non-local directory (don't allow running commands from non
    local dir, only built-ins)
- globs (non-Windows only, Windows programs do their own glob expansion)
- FILE_ENTRY, TOGGLE_ENTRY, more GUI controls in commando
- commando: lower case tag names?
- shift-click on toolbar button runs without displaying dialog box
- after jEdit API additions: tips of the day
