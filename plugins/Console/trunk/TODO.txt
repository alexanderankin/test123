- cdpath feature:
  %cdpath_add <dir>
  %cdpath_remove <dir>
  %cdpath_list <dir>
  and maybe an option pane
- file name, built-in, alias completion
- keep browser dir and console dir in sync
- ${beanshell:...} syntax
- aliases option pane
- file manipulation builtins - %ls, %mv, %cp, %rm, %touch, %cat?

    local dir, only built-ins)
- globs (non-Windows only, Windows programs do their own glob expansion)
