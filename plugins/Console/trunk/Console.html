<h1>General Information</h1>
</a>

The console plugin allows the user to run commands in various
available <i>shells</i>. The default shell runs
system processes (such as programs, compilers, etc). Other plugins,
for example BeanShell, add shells of their own which perform other
tasks.<p>

A console can be opened by selecting Plugins&gt;Console.<p>

Each console window has a number of tabs, one tab for each installed
shell. Each tab has a text field where commands can be entered, and
an output area that lists output of running commands.<p>

Pressing enter in the command field will execute the
currently entered command. The command field supports a history;
basically you can use the Up/Down arrow keys to recall previous commands.
See the section on history text fields in the jEdit manual for details.<p>

Entering `clear' will remove all text from the console.<p>

<b>Tip</b>: if you find yourself executing the same console command frequently,
record it in a macro. Simply enter the command in the console while a
macro recording is in progress.<p>

<h1>The Console Shell</h1>
</a>

The default console shell runs operating system commands.
To use it, select the <b>Console</b> tab in a console window.<p>

The default shell understands the following variables as part of a command:

<ul>
<li>~ - expands to the user's home directory
<li>$d - expands to the current file's parent directory
<li>$f - expands to the current file's full path
<li>$u - expands to the current file's URL (file: is prepended if it is
a local file)
<li>$j - expands to the directory where jEdit is installed
<li>$n - expands to the current file's name, without the trailing extension,
if any
<li>$$ - expands to the $ character
</ul>

The default shell also parses command output for compiler errors. A number
of different formats are supported.
<!-- , and new error patterns can be added
in <b>Utilities</b>&gt;<b>Console</b>&gt;<b>Global Options</b>. -->

<h1>Using Other Shells</h1>
</a>

A few other plugins define shells of their own; BeanShell is an example
of this. To use an alternative shell, select its tab in the console window.<p>

Note that
other shells cannot use the console's variable expansion or error parsing
services.

<hr>

<a name=toolbar>
<h1>The Console Tool Bar</h1>
</a>

If enabled in <b>Utilities</b>&gt;<b>Global Options</b>&gt;<b>Console</b>,
the console will add a tool bar to each view allowing quick and easy
command invocation.

<a name=faq>
<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
</a>

<h2>Why can't I change directories in the console?</h2>

At the moment, Java doesn't support changing the current working directory
(user.dir).

<h2>Why can't I use commands like 'dir' in the default shell on Windows</h2>

On Windows 95 and 98, some commands, such as dir, del, mkdir, type
and several others are internal to COMMAND.COM, the MS-DOS command
interpreter. To invoke them you must enter the following in the console:

<pre>command.com /c <i>command</i></pre>

On Windows NT, the same commands are internal to CMD.EXE, the 32-bit
command interpreter. To invoke them you must enter the following in
the console:

<pre>cmd /c <i>command</i></pre>
