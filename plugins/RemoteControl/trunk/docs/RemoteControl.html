<p>This plugin is a remote control for jEdit. It is used to open a remote api to control jEdit over the network.
To be useful you will need an external application that will be the client.</p>
<h2>Protocol description</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The network protocol works over <b>TCP</b>, the default port is <b>53348</b>. The data are text encoded in
	<b>UTF-8</b>.<br/>Using that protocol you will be able to send commands to jEdit (beanshell, invoke actions),
	receive the result of your commands, and listen for EBMessage from EditBus.<br/>
	The protocol is asynchronous, this mean that you can receive messages at any time, and that when you invoke
	actions the action result will not be returned immediately (it is quick but you could receive other events
	between your request and the response).
</p>
<p>Before being able to send and receive messages, you have to identify you. It is the handshake, that is described
   next</p>
<h3>Handshake</h3>
To start a connection the plugin can have different options : <b>challenge</b>, <b>handshake</b> or nothing.
Challenge have a little security to ensure that anyone will not connect to your jEdit, handshake is only a welcome
message and nothing is no security at all.
By default RemoteControl will ask for a <b>challenge</b>.
This is to ensure a minimal security.
<h4>Challenge</h4>
<p>
The default mode. It uses a pincode that must be the same on jEdit and on your client. That code is never sent on the
network and must be entered as a setting of your program and of the RemoteControl plugin.
By default this pincode is <b>1234</b></p>

<p>When you connect, you have to send <b>jEdit-RemoteServer-Hello\n</b><br/>
	Immediately you will receive <b>jEdit-RemoteServer-Welcome-Challenge-xxxx</b> where <i>xxxx</i> is a random
	text.
	With that text you have to calculate the md5 of pincode+jEdit-RemoteServer-Welcome-Challenge-xxxx
	for example
	md5(1234jEdit-RemoteServer-Welcome-Challenge-xxxx).
	<br/>then you return
	<b>jEdit-RemoteServer-Challenge-Answer-yyyyy</b> where yyyyy is the md5 hash you just calculated.
	If your hash is good, you will receive <b>jEdit-RemoteServer-Welcome</b>, otherwise the connection will be
	closed

<h3>Invoke an action</h3>
To invoke an action just send<br>
<i>A:actionname</i>
<br>ex:<br>
<i>A:next-buffer</i>
<br>
Invoking an action do not return anything and you don't know when it is invoked (it is quick but not immediate)

<h3>Invoke random code</h3>
To invoke a random code send (carreful the 3 : are important)<br>
<i>S:[transactionId]:[engine]:beanshell</i><br>
The transactionId is an optional String. If you don't provide one, it means you don't want the result of your code.
Otherwise you can send any text you like (it is not interpreted by the plugin, and you will get a result that will
contains your transactionId and the result of your command.<br>
The engine is also optional, at this time the only allowed value is bsh, or empty value (both are calling the beanshell
engine.
<i>S:::beanshell</i>
<br>ex:<br>
<i>S:::jEdit.newView(null);</i>
<br>
If you want to get the result of that command you have.
<h3>Registering and unregistering EBMessages</h3>
To receive EBMessage you have to register as a listener for them.<br>
Register a message<br>
<i>R:org.gjt.sp.jedit.msg.ViewUpdate</i>
or <br>
<i>R:org.gjt.sp.jedit.msg.ViewUpdate,org.gjt.sp.jedit.msg.BufferUpdate</i>
<br>Unregister a message<br>
<i>U:org.gjt.sp.jedit.msg.ViewUpdate</i>
or <br>
<i>U:org.gjt.sp.jedit.msg.ViewUpdate,org.gjt.sp.jedit.msg.BufferUpdate</i>
