* improve word movement to be more like Vim (can use TextObjects).

* error reporting should be moved out of VimageMap and should throw instead. The
parser should print the error and be passed the filename of what it's parsing.

* '.' support is broken.

* macro recording needs to be tested.

* figure out a better way than the special handling for vimage.cut and
vimage.copy in VimageInputHandler.java.

* cleanup the recording code in VimageInputHandler.java.
