        <h1>Vimage</h1>
        
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        
            <p>Vimage is a jEdit plugin that adds Vim like key binding emulation to
            jEdit. The plugin provides a flexible modal input layer and a set of
            actions which emulate Vim.</p>
            
            <p>Familiarity with Vim is expected. Vimage is currently incomplete
            and doesn't emulate the entirety of Vim's keybindings. In addition,
            some Vimage operations don't mimic the Vim counterparts exactly (for
            example, word based cursor movement).</p>
        
        <h2>Key Bindings</h2>
        
            <p>Vimage comes equipped with a default set of keybindings that
            approximates most of Vim. The keybindings can be extended by
            providing new key mapping files.</p>
            
            <h3>User Mappings</h3>
            
                <p>Vimage keybindings are defined in simple text files. They
                have the following layout:
                    <b><pre>MODE_NAME KEY_COMBINATION { BeanShell Action }</pre></b>
                    <b>MODE_NAME</b>
                    instructs the Vimage mapping parser which mode owns the
                    following key/action pair. Vimage provides a flexible modal
                    input system supporting an unlimited number of input modes.
                    Each mode is a grouping of keyboard shortcuts and associated
                    actions. The current mode can be changed through the
                    BeanShell Action. Vimage actually supports 2 current modes,
                    the current base mode and the current overlay mode. As the
                    names imply, the overlay mode adds or overrides key/action
                    pairs of the base mode. We'll give more specifics and
                    examples of modes later.<br><br>
                    <b>KEY_COMBINATION</b>
                    defines the key combination that will trigger the
                    following BeanShell action block. These are written in
                    standard jEdit keyboard shortcut syntax. See below and
                    Appendix A. in the jEdit Help for more examples.<br><br>
                    <b>{ BeanShell Action }</b>
                    is a standard BeanShell block that will be invoked when
                    Vimage is in mode MODE_NAME and KEY_COMBINATION is pressed.
                    Vimage adds some special variables to the BeanShell
                    namespace which are outlined below. </p>
                
            <h3>User Mapping Directory</h3>
            
                <p>Vimage looks in the jEdit settings directory for a
                sub-directory named mappings. It loads every file in the
                mappings directory parsing the contained key mapping
                declarations.</p>
                
        <h2>Quick Mapping Tutorial</h2>
        
            <p>We're going to add a mapping to Vimage which invokes the SideKick
            tree (SideKick is a great jEdit plugin which shows the structure of
            the current buffer).
            <ol>
                <li>Start by creating the mappings directory:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Open jEdit's open file dialog.
                        <li>Change directories to the jEdit settings directory
                        (typically ~/.jedit, but varies by platform, see <i>The
                        jEdit Settings Directory</i> in the jEdit help for more
                        info).
                        <li>Open the Command menu and choose "New Directory".
                        <li>Name the new directory mappings.
                        <li>Change into the newly created mappings directory.
                    </ol>
                <li>Create a new file, let's name it nmap. The filename doesn't
                matter, it is typically convenient to name the files after the
                mode defined in the file (nmap is one of the 4 default modes
                provided by Vimage and is the default mode).
                <li>Add the following text to the file and save it:
                    <pre>nmap C+MINUS { _("sidekick-tree"); }</pre>
                <li>Tell Vimage to reload the mappings using the Vimage action
                <i>vimage.reload-maps</i> (see <i>The Action Bar</i> in the
                jEdit help for how to use actions with the action bar).
                <li>Finally, use the new shortcut. Hit escape to make sure
                Vimage is in the nmap mode, then press C+MINUS (control and
                minus at the same time). If you have the SideKick plugin
                installed you should now be looking the tree dockable.
            </ol>
            </p>
            
        <h2>Mappings in Depth</h2>
        
            <h3>BeanShell Namespace Additions</h3>
            
                <p>Vimage adds the following variables to the Vimage BeanShell
                namespace (the namespace in which all mapping actions are
                executed).
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>count</b> is the current count. Most Vimage
                        operations can be repeated by first supplying an
                        optional count.
                        <li><b>key</b> is the key that triggered the action.
                        This is explained more in the <i>Mappings That Take a
                        Key</i> section. It is an instance of jEdit's
                        KeyEventTranslator.Key class.
                        <li><b>mode</b> is the Vimage mode object. Its public
                        interface can be accessed through this variable.
                    </ul>
                
                <p>Vimage adds the following functions to the Vimage BeanShell
                namespace.
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>_(String a)</b> executes the jEdit action a.
                        <li><b>__(String m)</b> causes Vimage to switch to
                        mode m.
                    </ul>
                    
            <h3>Mappings That Take a Key</h3>
            
                <p>For some shortcuts it's not enough to be triggered, they need
                additional input in the form of a key press. For example, the
                standard Vim command to move to the next letter on a line
                requires the character as input. Vimage supports this through
                special mode names.</p>
                
                <p>Modes that end in "-key" are special. They should only have a
                single key mapping - "*". For example, here is the default
                mapping to select a register:
                    <pre>nmap " { __("register-key"); }</pre>
                    <pre>register-key * { mode.setRegister(key.input); }</pre>
                    
                <p>"-key" modes are expected to take only a single character as
                input. After the "-key" action is executed, the mode is
                automatically put back to the last used base mode (see the next
                section about base modes).</p>
                    
        <h2>The 5 Base Modes</h2>

            <p>Vimage adds 5 modes by default. They are nmap, imap, vmap,
            omap, and command. 
                <ul> 
                    <li><b>nmap</b> is the default mode. This corresponds to
                    Vim's normal mode. Pressing escape causes Vimage to
                    return to normal mode. This key binding can not be
                    overridden.
                    <li><b>imap</b> is the input mode. This mode corresponds
                    to entering text. Any keys that don't match a key/action
                    pair are passed as input to jEdit's textarea.
                    <li><b>vmap</b> is the visual selection mode. In this
                    mode cursor movement will extend the selection.
                    <li><b>omap</b> is the operator pending mode. For
                    example, with no select hitting "d" in nmap will cause
                    Vimage to enter omap waiting for another keystroke
                    indication what to delete.
                    <li><b>command</b> is a special mode corresponding to
                    the Vimage command line. The command line is accessed
                    using the ':' key from the nmap mode. Currently this
                    mode is limited in that arguments supplied on the
                    command line are not forwarded to the action.
                </ul>
                
        <h2>Overlay Modes</h2>
        
            <p>Occasionally it makes sense to add or override key/action pairs
            while maintaining the base mode. Vimage supports this through the
            mode.pushMode function. For example, to support line-wise commands
            when a key is pressed twice (e.g. dd, yy, cc, etc.), the default key
            bindings push an overlay mode that change the key binding for the
            duplicate key.
                
        <h2>Viewing the Mappings</h2>
            
            <p>Vimage provides a <i>vimage.show-keybindings</i> action which
            prints the current modes and their key/action pairs to a new jEdit
            buffer.
