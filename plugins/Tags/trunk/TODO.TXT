- Both focus issues (does this still happen on Sun?)

- Cleanup display of tag collisions...
   - search string...



Version > initial public release version
----------------------------------------
- Tag collisions.  See vim...
   - ExuberantCTags collision strings...
      - Make choose tag list a part of the parser, so that each parser can have
        its own list item renderer.

      - Plugin GenericChooseTagList into ChooseTagListPopup
      - continue...

- Feature request: show the list of tags whose names start with the text
  already entered in the field, inside the dialog box, and update that list on
  the fly as characters are typed. You could add a key listener to the text 
  field to pass up and down arrow key presses to the list.

- When tagging from enter tag dialog, put up a collision dialog instead of
  the collision popup list.

- UI help strings

- Cleanup displayMessage to take arg (INFO, ERROR).  Also don't use Macros as
  you can't change the title of the dialog.
   - Also display message in case of tag index files == 0 && using cwd ./tags
     file but it doesn't exist.
     
- Ability to set num of columns for filename in tag collision dialog
        
- Ability to switch to a different set of tag files easily (shouldn't have to
  remove and add a whole new set).  The catagory stuff is a step in this
  direction.

- ETagsParser.java?

- History panel in Enter Tag dialog.
        
- Exuberant C Tags FAQ page has info about other source code analyzers (sp?),
  such as where a function is called from etc.  Look at these tools and see
  about either integrating them into Tags, or as a closly related plugin. 
        
- Possibly recursively search the parent directory for a tags file.  (DIRECT 
  FEEDBACK).  

- Progress dialog with the ability to stop if tagging is taking more than 1
  second...? 

- Tag stack
   - Ability to view tag stack and select to goto item...
      - Netscape style toolbar back and forward buttons/commands?
   - View local tag stack...
      - This should probably have a hash table based on the View?
   - Perhaps if we open up another window when tagging we should add to tag
     stack.  Perhaps it should behave as Netscape?  Is that bad?
   - As a dockable window
   
- When searching file, check func at end of file to see if we should even be
  checking this file...

- Ability to goto the next matching tag.
