TODO (next release)
-------------------
- Update to 4.0 (only if there is some 4.0 feature needed)
   - Use JEditTextArea.physicalToVirtual() instead of
     Buffer.physicalToVirtual(). 
     
- ./tag checkbox usage puts ./tags in file list for user to reorder... 

      /* Don't forget to call this listener when the dialog comes up to ensure
       * that it is in the list.  Don't add if already there...
       */

- Acknowledge beta testers in documentation

- Feature request: show the list of tags whose names start with the
  text already entered in the field, inside the dialog box, and update
  that list on the fly as characters are typed. You could add a key
  listener to the text field to pass up and down arrow key presses to
  the list.
  
- Clear tag stack command

- History panel in Enter Tag dialog.

- When searching file, check func at end of file to see if we should
  even be checking this file... 

- UI help strings

- Ability to switch to a different set of tag files easily (shouldn't
  have to remove and add a whole new set).  The catagory stuff is a
  step in this direction.  Get list of tag files from project plugin
  like Ant does... 
  or
  
  Have checkboxes where you can uncheck and it won't be searched.
  This way you don't have to completely remove the tag file and then
  have to look for it with the file browser again.

  This can wait until a later release
  
TODO (later releases)
--------------------

- jet_unix to use tag dialog

- Ability to set num of columns for filename in tag collision dialog.
  Automatically do it if collision list popup/dialog is larger than
  screen. 
  
- ETagsParser.java?

- Exuberant C Tags FAQ page has info about other source code analyzers
  (sp?), such as where a function is called from etc.  Look at these
  tools and see about either integrating them into Tags, or as a
  closly related plugin. 
  
- Possibly recursively search the parent directory for a tags file. 
  (DIRECT FEEDBACK). 

- Progress dialog with the ability to stop if tagging is taking more
  than 1 second...? 
  - Use I/O progress monitor?
  - Display wait cursor if taking more than a certain length of time.

- Tag stack
   - Ability to view tag stack and select to goto item...
      - Netscape style toolbar back and forward buttons/commands?
   - View local tag stack...
      - This should probably have a hash table based on the View?
   - Perhaps if we open up another window when tagging we should add
     to tag stack.  Perhaps it should behave as Netscape?  Is that
     bad? 
   - As a dockable window
   
- Ability to goto the next matching tag.
