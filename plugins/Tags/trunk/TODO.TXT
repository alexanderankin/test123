Version > initial public release version
----------------------------------------
- When tagging from enter tag dialog, put up a collision dialog instead of
  the collision list?

- Tag collisions.  See vim...
   - ExuberantCTags collision strings...
      - Make choose tag list a part of the parser, so that each parser can have
        its own list item renderer.

- Ability to set num of columns for filename
        
- Ability to switch to a different set of tag files easily (shouldn't have to
  remove and add a whole new set).  The catagory stuff is a step in this
  direction.

- handle this.something specially (i.e. turn it into ClassName.something)

- ETagsParser.java?

- Use properties to store values
   - better naming scheme
      - tags.options.something.label
      - tags.options.something.title
      
      - tags.options.open-new-view=false
      - tags.enter-tag.title
      
      - tags.ok.label
      - tags.cancel.label
   
   - TagsPlugin.getOptionString() to TagsPlugin.getString()
   
- History panel in Enter Tag dialog.
        
- Use properties to store values
   - Size and position of Tag To: dialog
   - previous value of "open new view" in Tag To: dialog.
   - Previous loaded tag files.
  
- Possibly recursively search the parent directory for a tags file.  (DIRECT 
  FEEDBACK).  

- Progress dialog with the ability to stop if tagging is taking more than 1
  second... 

- Tag stack
   - Ability to view tag stack and select to goto item...
      - Netscape style toolbar back and forward buttons/commands?
   - View local tag stack...
      - This should probably have a hash table based on the View?
   - Perhaps if we open up another window when tagging we should add to tag
     stack.  Perhaps it should behave as Netscape?  Is that bad?

- When searching file, check func at end of file to see if we should even be
  checking this file...

- Ability to goto the next matching tag  
  
  
Limitations/Known Bugs
----------------------  
- Making a change to the tag files in the Global Options dialog, and then
  pressing Cancel in the Global Options dialog, the tag file changes will 
  stick.
- Has only been tested in C and Java.
- Currently when using exuberant c tags we are not using any of the extra
  tag info.  I'm not sure what we would want to use it for.  It doesn't seem
  as if vi or vim use this information (NOTE:  I only did a quick 5 min.
  check).
- Tag files *MUST* be sorted.  Else, the tag will probably never be found
  b/c we are using a binary searching mechanism. 
- Bachward searching patterns (?...?) are not supported.
- Currently you can't mix types of tag files.  This really only comes into play
  when mixing c tag files with exuberant c tag files with --format=2.  If one
  really wants to do this, setting the tag parser to exuberant c will do so...
- On Sun Java, Enter tag dialog has shortcut character in input panel.
