Before 1.0 (public release)
---------------------------
      


Version > initial public release version
----------------------------------------
- Tag collisions.  See vim...
   - ExuberantCTags collision strings...
      - Make choose tag list a part of the parser, so that each parser can have
        its own list item renderer.

      - Plugin GenericChooseTagList into ChooseTagListPopup
      - continue...
        
- When tagging from enter tag dialog, put up a collision dialog instead of
  the collision popup list.

- UI help strings

- Cleanup displayMessage to take arg (INFO, ERROR).  Also don't use Macros as
  you can't change the title of the dialog.
   - Also display message in case of tag index files == 0 && using cwd ./tags
     file but it doesn't exist.
     
- Ability to set num of columns for filename
        
- Ability to switch to a different set of tag files easily (shouldn't have to
  remove and add a whole new set).  The catagory stuff is a step in this
  direction.

- ETagsParser.java?

- History panel in Enter Tag dialog.
        
- Possibly recursively search the parent directory for a tags file.  (DIRECT 
  FEEDBACK).  

- Progress dialog with the ability to stop if tagging is taking more than 1
  second...? 

- Tag stack
   - Ability to view tag stack and select to goto item...
      - Netscape style toolbar back and forward buttons/commands?
   - View local tag stack...
      - This should probably have a hash table based on the View?
   - Perhaps if we open up another window when tagging we should add to tag
     stack.  Perhaps it should behave as Netscape?  Is that bad?

- When searching file, check func at end of file to see if we should even be
  checking this file...

- Ability to goto the next matching tag.  

- Wrap around selection in collision list.
