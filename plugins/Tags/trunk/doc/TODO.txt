Tags Todo
=========

Version 1.1
===========

* 4.2 plugin api (DONE)
* refactor options pane
  - use CTagsPlugin storage method, to handle paths with spaces (DONE)
* consolidate parser classes into one ExuberantCTagsParser (DONE)
* return focus to TextArea when ESC is entered on ChooseTagListPopup (DONE)
* add a TagFiles and move TagFile management into that -- it should
  live in TagsPlugin and only load tag files when needed (and should
  take care of emptying them when properties are changed) (DONE)
* integrate TagStack dockable (DONE)
* tidy up logging
  - too much in tag parsing
  - not enough elsewhere
* put all strings into properties
* buffer local props
* make sure all appropriate references are released when plugin is unloaded
* BUG: sometimes the default tag index file is not recognized as such,
  meaning the parent directories are not searched.
* BUG: sometimes popping tags, the context of the edit pane
  is out of sync with the buffer displayed.  for example, the
  buffer switcher shows buffer a but the contents are buffer b. (DONE)
* BUG: change default for search for tags is current buffer to True
  otherwise, the default is added, but the option is off -- which
  get them out of sync.
* BUG: on linux focus is returned to the text area instead of the
  tag collisions dialog when it opens (DONE)
* add icons for positions in TagStack (tag,jump,explicit)?


Later
=====

* pattern based (RE) matching (Me)
* interface w/PV?
* generate tag files?
* case-insenstive search (Slava)
* incremental search? (Slava)
* forward and backwards to tag stack (Ken)
* Keep current position on top of stack?  Maybe if
  it's not in the same line as the topmost element
  in the stack (if the stack is not empty) -- it would
  just be TagStackModel.getTopMost.goTo() (Me)
* option to close buffers if clean and opened by
  following a tag (Me)
