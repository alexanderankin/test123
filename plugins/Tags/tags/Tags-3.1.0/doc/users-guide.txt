Introduction
============

The Tags plugin allows one to "jump" to the definition of a
class, function, variable, etc... using tag index files.
For example, in C programs, the user can immediately jump to the
definition of a desired function or data structure without having
to know where or what file it is defined. Tag jumping can be
accomplished by either selecting the desired tag, placing the
cursor on the tag, or entering the tag.

Tag index files are created by `ctags`_ (http://ctags.sourceforge.net/).

.. _ctags: http://ctags.sourceforge.net/

Creating Tag Index Files
========================

For the Tags plugin to be useful, you must generate tag index files
using `ctags`.

To generate a tag index file for all source files in the 
current directory::
	
	ctags *

To generate a tag index file or all source files in the
current directory and child directories::
	
	ctags -R

See the man page or documentation that comes with your version
of `ctags` for more information on using `ctags`.

Note that file paths in tag index file are relative to the 
generated file, unless you pass absolute paths to `ctags`.

**Tag index files must be sorted, as the Tags plugin searches
using a binary search. By default Exuberant CTags sorts generated
tag index files.**

Usage
=====

Tag Jumping
-----------

There are 2 ways to jump to a desired tag:

1. Place the cursor on or select the desired tag. Use
   `Plugins` > `Tags` > `Follow Tag`.  `Plugins` > `Tags` >
   `Follow Tag (New View)` will jump to a tag in a new view.

2. `Plugins` > `Tags` > `Follow Tag...` will prompt you for
   the desired tag. The `Open new view` checkbox will jump
   to the entered tag in an new view.

The Tag Stack
-------------

The `Tag Stack` provides a visual history of tags you've followed
and where you've jumped from.  When you jump to (or `follow`) a 
tag, both the location you jumped from and the location of the 
tag you followed are pushed onto the `Tag Stack`.  Aside from
seeing how you've moved through buffers, the `Tag Stack` enables
you to jump to any of the positions in the stack.

For each position, the `Tag Stack` displays the line number, filename
and directory and the contents of the line (in bold).  The line before
and after are also displayed to provide some context.

The context menu for the `Tag Stack` provides the follow actions:

`Go to`:
	Move the caret to the position, leaving the item on the stack.

`Remove`:
	Remove the selected element from the `Tag Stack`, without
	changing the caret position.

`Pop`:
	Move the caret to the topmost position on the stack, and remove
	the topmost position.

`Clear`:
	Removes all positions from the `Tag Stack` without moving the caret.

`Tag Stack` actions are accessible via `Plugins` > `Tags`:

`Pop Position`:
	Return to the topmost position on the stack.  This will
	also remove the position from the `Tag Stack`.

`Push Position onto Tag Stack`:
	Puts your current position at the top of the `Tag Stack`.

`Clear Tag Stack`:
	Removes all elements from the `Tag Stack`.

Each jEdit `View` has it's own stack.

Tag Collisions
--------------

A tag collision can occur when there is more than one defintion
for a specific tag as defined in the tag index files. This
especially occurs on object oriented programming languages, and
local projects where you are using a global system tag index
file along with a local tag index file. To easily facilitate
tag collisions, if more than one tag is found in the tag index
files, you are presented, located under the cursor, a list of
choices. You can select the desired tag by either using the
mouse, keyboard arrow keys or number keys (1 - 9 only).  The
tag collision list can be dismissed with the Escape (`Esc`) key.
The tag collision list can also be converted to a dialog
with the Space key.

If the `Tag List` dockable window is open, the list will be shown
in the dockable window instead of in a pop-up window. The
`Tag List` dockable window provides a 'Filter' menu using which
you can quickly filter the list of tags by the available attribute
values.

Configuration
=============

The Tags plugin can be configured under the `Plugins` >
`Plugin Options...`.

General
-------

`Position dialogs under cursor`:

    If your window manager is set to have window focus
    follow the mouse pointer, and doesn't automatically
    shift the window focus to new dialogs/windows,
    this option can be helpful. Any dialog that the
    plugin creates will be automatically placed under
    the cursor. This is currently experimental. Note
    that this doesn't work well for window managers
    which automatically shift focus to new dialogs/windows.

`Tags extend through member access operator`:

    When tagging in the text area, the plugin by
    default will consider the tag to be the word
    under the cursor as well as any member access.

`If tag match is found continue searching subsequent tag index files`:

    By default, the first matching tag (or groups of tags
    if a tag collision occurs) found will stop the search.
    Using this option will allow all tag files to be searched,
    results in searches taking longer.

`Use line numbers when following tags, if specified in the tag files`:

    Invoking Ctags with:
	
	--fields=+l
	
    causes it to add a "line" attribute to each tag, specifying
    the line number in which the tag is defined. By default,
    the "follow tag" operation ignores the line attribute of the
    tag and uses the pattern to locate the tag. This has the
    advantage that the tag may be located even if the file has
    changed since it was indexed by Ctags.
    However, using the pattern to locate the
    tag does not work if there are multiple tags with the same
    name and pattern in the file, which is common in object
    oriented languages (e.g. an actionPerformed method in
    several anonymous Java classes defined in the same file, or
    a C function definition and forward declaration in the same
    file).
    In such cases, the line numbers can be used to locate the
    tags. If the line attributes are specified in the tag files,
    using this option causes the "follow tag" operation to jump
    to the specified line number instead of searching for the
    pattern.

`Number of tag files to keep in memory`:

    The tags plugin caches remote tag index files, when
    editing over FTP, SFTP, etc...  To avoid loading remote
    tag index files every time you wish to jump to a tag
    defintion, these are cached.  This value controls how
    many remote index files to cache in memory.

`Keep local tags files in memory`

    If enabled, tag index file located on the local filesystem
    are cached in memory, just as remote ones, rather than
    reading them as a RandomAccessFile.  This may result
    in slightly faster searching, but can dramatically increase
    memory usage.

Actions
-------

List of actions that provide the "follow tag" functionality with
filtering of the tag list in case of collisions. For example,
you can create an action that jumps only to function prototypes,
or only to tags that belong to a certain class.
The filtering is based on tag attributes. Ctags provides command-
line options for adding various tag attributes (fields) to its
tag files, such as access, class, kind, scope etc. For custom
actions to work, this attribute information must exist in the tag
files.

Each action that you add has a name, an associated attribute and
a list of values for that attribute. When the action is invoked,
it first runs the "follow tag" action, and if tags are found,
it goes over the list of values one by one, and for each value
it reduces the list to only those tags having this value for
the attribute. If tags were found to have this value for the
attribute, these tags are then used for jumping or for the tag
collision popup/dockable. If no tags in the list have any of
the values, the action indicates that no tags were found.

Tag Files
---------

List of tag index files the Tags plugin uses to search for 
tag definitions.

"tags" is a special entry that doesn't represent an actual 
file but rather the name of the file to look for in the current
buffer's directory.  The Tags plugin can also search for this
file in the current buffer's parent directories.  Double-click 
on the entry to edit it.

The order of entries in the list is the order in which files
will be searched.

Suggested Keyboard Shortcuts and UI
===================================

Here are some suggested key bindings. These do stomp on
some jEdit key bindings, but I find that they work well.
They are based on the vi (and it's clones) key bindings
for tagging.

====================== ===========
 Action                 Shortcut
====================== ===========
Follow Tag             C+]
Follow Tag (New View)  C+S+]
Follow Tag...          A+]
Pop Position           C+T
====================== ===========

Keyboard shortcuts can be defined under the `Shortcuts` node
of the `Global Options` dialog.

Also one can place the tagging commands in the Context Menu.
Context menu items can be defined under the `Context Menu`
node of the Global Options dialog.

Where to Find `ctags`
=====================

You can find the Exuberant C Tags program at:

   http://ctags.sourceforge.net

Exuberant C Tags is also included in the cygwin distribution
for Windows.

You can also use the standard UNIX ctags program, or the GNU
C Tags program, but you'll find that Exuberant C Tags
provides a bit more info (or too much depending on how much
of a minimalist you are).

Known Bugs/Limitations
======================

* Tag index files **MUST** be sorted. This is becuase
  tags are search for using a binary search.
* Bachward searching patterns ``(?...?)`` are not supported.
