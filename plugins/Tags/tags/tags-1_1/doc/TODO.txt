Tags Plugin To Do List
======================

Items below may or may not appear in a future release of this 
plugin -- it's more a collection of ideas than a task list.

Version 1.1
===========

* 4.2 plugin api (DONE)
* refactor options pane

  - use CTagsPlugin storage method, to handle paths with spaces (DONE)

* consolidate parser classes into one ExuberantCTagsParser (DONE)
* return focus to TextArea when ESC is entered on ChooseTagListPopup (DONE)
* add a TagFiles and move TagFile management into that -- it should
  live in TagsPlugin and only load tag files when needed (and should
  take care of emptying them when properties are changed) (DONE)
* integrate TagStack dockable (DONE)
* tidy up logging

  - too much in tag parsing
  - not enough elsewhere

* put all strings into properties
* buffer local props
* make sure all appropriate references are released when plugin is unloaded
* BUG: sometimes the default tag index file is not recognized as such,
  meaning the parent directories are not searched.
* BUG: sometimes popping tags, the context of the edit pane
  is out of sync with the buffer displayed.  for example, the
  buffer switcher shows buffer a but the contents are buffer b. (DONE)
* BUG: change default for search for tags is current buffer to True
  otherwise, the default is added, but the option is off -- which
  get them out of sync.
* BUG: on linux focus is returned to the text area instead of the
  tag collisions dialog when it opens (DONE)
* add icons for positions in TagStack (tag,jump,explicit)?

Later
=====

* pattern based (RE) matching (Me)
* interface w/PV?
* generate tag files?
* case-insenstive search (Slava)
* incremental search? (Slava)
* forward and backwards to tag stack (Ken)
* Keep current position on top of stack?  Maybe if
  it's not in the same line as the topmost element
  in the stack (if the stack is not empty) -- it would
  just be TagStackModel.getTopMost.goTo() (Me)
* option to close buffers when popping a tag if it's clean 
  and it was opened when following a tag.  otherwise
  it's easy to end up with *lots* of open buffers. (Me)

Ken's List
==========

Item's which Ken had listed as To do's -- either for the next 
version or for a future version.

- Feature request: show the list of tags whose names start with the
  text already entered in the field, inside the dialog box, and update
  that list on the fly as characters are typed. You could add a key
  listener to the text field to pass up and down arrow key presses to
  the list.

   * How to get dialog to dynamically change size...
   * Check out use of setDefaultCloseOperation()
   * Nix TagsEnterTagPanel.java

- Should probably unify the Enter Tag dialog and the Tag collision
  dialog.  Conversion from the popup to the dialog should use the
  Enter tag dialog, where it populate the various components of the
  dialog (i.e. new view, history text field).

- UI help strings

- Should move the common key handling code of the collision list into
  the list class.

- Ability to set num of columns for filename in tag collision dialog.
  Automatically do it if collision list popup/dialog is larger than
  screen.

- Exuberant C Tags FAQ page has info about other source code analyzers
  (sp?), such as where a function is called from etc.  Look at these
  tools and see about either integrating them into Tags, or as a
  closly related plugin.

- Progress dialog with the ability to stop if tagging is taking more
  than 1 second...?

  * Use I/O progress monitor?
  * Display wait cursor if taking more than a certain length of time.

- Tag stack

  * Netscape style toolbar back and forward buttons/commands?
  * Perhaps if we open up another window when tagging we should add
    to tag stack.  Perhaps it should behave as Netscape?  Is that
    bad?

- Ability to goto the next matching tag.
