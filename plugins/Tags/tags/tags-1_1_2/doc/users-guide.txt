Introduction
============

The Tags plugin allows a user to jump to the definition of a
specific language object or "tag" using tag index files.
For example, in C programs, the user can immediatly jump to the
definition of a desired function or data structure without having
to know where or what file it is defined. Tag jumping can be
accomplished by either selecting the desired tag, placing the
cursor on the tag, or entering the tag.

The tag index files are created by the `ctags`_ program of which
there are several versions. ctags can be found on most UNIX
systems. The `Exuberant C Tags`_ program has both UNIX and Windows
versions.

Creating Tag Index Files
========================

Without tag index files the Tags plugin is useless.  Well, not
necessarily useless; it will let you know it can't find or
jump to anything which can be of some use. Tag files are
created with the ctags program.

For more extensive help on the ctags program see the
documentation that comes with your distribution (man pages,
readme files).  But, in general you can create tag index
files with the Exuberant C Tag commands::

     ctags *     create a tag file in the current directory for all recognized
                 source files
     ctags -R    create a tag file in the current directory for all files in
                 an entire source directory tree.

Please note that the tag index files list definition file
names based on path that you pass to the ctags program. If you
don't pass the full path of the files to ctags, the definition
file names listed in the tag index file will be relative to
the current directory. If this is not desired you can pass ``$cwd``
or `pwd` to ctags::

     ctags $cwd/*
     ctags -R $cwd

**Tag index files are search using a binary search, so tag index
files must be sorted.**

Usage
=====

Tag Jumping
-----------

There are 2 ways to jump to a desired tag:

1. Place the cursor on or select the desired tag. Use
   `Plugins` > `Tags` > `Follow Tag`.  `Plugins` > `Tags` >
   `Follow Tag (New View)` will jump to a tag in a new view.

2. `Plugins` > `Tags` > `Follow Tag...` will prompt you for
   the desired tag. The `Open new view` checkbox will jump
   to the entered tag in an new view.

The Tag Stack
-------------

The `Tag Stack` provides a visual history of tags you've followed
and where you've jumped from.  When you jump to (or `follow`) a 
tag, both the location you jumped from and the location of the 
tag you followed are pushed onto the `Tag Stack`.  Aside from
seeing how you've moved through buffers, the `Tag Stack` enables
you to jump to any of the positions in the stack.

For each position, the `Tag Stack` displays the line number, filename
and directory and the contents of the line (in bold).  The line before
and after are also displayed to provide some context.

The context menu for the `Tag Stack` provides the follow actions:

`Go to`:
	Move the caret to the position, leaving the item on the stack.

`Remove`:
	Remove the selected element from the `Tag Stack`, without
	changing the caret position.

`Pop`:
	Move the caret to the topmost position on the stack, and remove
	the topmost position.

`Clear`:
	Removes all positions from the `Tag Stack` without moving the caret.

`Tag Stack` actions are accessible via `Plugins` > `Tags`:

`Pop Position`:
	Return to the topmost position on the stack.  This will
	also remove the position from the `Tag Stack`.

`Push Position onto Tag Stack`:
	Puts your current position at the top of the `Tag Stack`.

`Clear Tag Stack`:
	Removes all elements from the `Tag Stack`.

Each jEdit `View` has it's own stack.

Tag Collisions
--------------

A tag collision can occur when there is more than one defintion
for a specific tag as defined in the tag index files. This
especially occurs on object oriented programming languages, and
local projects where you are using a global system tag index
file along with a local tag index file. To easily facilitate
tag collisions, if more than one tag is found in the tag index
files, you are presented, located under the cursor, a list of
choices. You can select the desired tag by either using the
mouse, keyboard arrow keys or number keys (1 - 9 only).  The
tag collision list can be dismissed with the Escape (`Esc`) key.
The tag collision list can also be converted to a dialog
with the Space key.

Configuration
=============

The Tags plugin can be configured under the `Plugins` >
`Plugin Options...`.

`Position dialogs under cursor (Experimental)`:

    If your window manager is set to have window focus
    follow the mouse pointer, and doesn't automatically
    shift the window focus to new dialogs/windows,
    this option can be helpful. Any dialog that the
    plugin creates will be automatically placed under
    the cursor. This is currently experimental. Note
    that this doesn't work well for window managers
    which automatically shift focus to new dialogs/windows.

`If tag match is found continue searching subsequent tag index files`:

    By default, the first matching tag (or groups of tags
    if a tag collision occurs) found will stop the search.
    Using this option will allow all tag files to be searched.

`Tags extend through member access operator`:

    When tagging in the text area, the plugin by
    default will consider the tag to be the word
    under the cursor as well as any member access.

`Search tag file in current buffer's directory`:

    Check this option if you want the tag search to
    use the tag index file in the current buffer's
    directory. After specifying this you will be able
    to change the search order of the tag index file.
    The default is for the tag index file to be searched
    first.

`Tag index file name`:

    If you have configured Tags to use the tag index
    file in the current buffer's directory you can
    change the file named that the plugin looks for.
    The default is "tags". This should be the file
    name without any path related characters.

`Search in parent directories, if no tag index file in buffer's directory`:

	Search up directory tree for tag index files for the
	current buffer, if none is found in the buffer's directory.

`Tag search files (in order of search)`:

    Add tag index files that should be searched to
    this table. The order of the table is the search
    order. You can also enable or disable a tag index
    file from being searched without having to remove the
    file path from the table.

Suggested Keyboard Shortcuts and UI
===================================

Here are some suggested key bindings. These do stomp on
some jEdit key bindings, but I find that they work well.
They are based on the vi (and it's clones) key bindings
for tagging.

::

     Follow Tag:             Ctrl + ]
     Follow Tag (New View):  Ctrl + SHIFT + ]
     Follow Tag...:          Alt + ]
     Pop Position:           Ctrl + T

Keyboard shortcuts can be defined under the `Shortcuts` node
of the `Global Options` dialog.

Also one can place the tagging commands in the Context Menu.
Context menu items can be defined under the `Context Menu`
node of the Global Options dialog.

Where to Find `ctags`
=====================

You can find the Exuberant C Tags program at:

   http://ctags.sourceforge.net

Exuberant C Tags is also included in the cygwin distribution
for Windows.

You can also use the standard UNIX ctags program, or the GNU
C Tags program, but you'll find that Exuberant C Tags
provides a bit more info (or too much depending on how much
of a minimalist you are).

Lincense
========

The source code is distributed under the GPL. Please see
http://www.fsf.org/copyleft/gpl.html.

Known Bugs/Limitations
======================

* Tag files **MUST** be sorted. Else, the tag will
  probably never be found b/c we are using a binary
  searching mechanism.
* Bachward searching patterns ``(?...?)`` are not supported.

Future Directions
=================

See TODO.TXT
