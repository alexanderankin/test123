===============

Version 1.1
===========

* updated for 4.2 plugin API

* removed all reference to TagFile.category
* return focus to TextArea when ESC is entered on ChooseTagListPopup
* removed ``_`` from variable names in TagFile.java
* changed format for saving tag index files.  old format will
  be converted to new format automatically.  This was done to
  make handle paths with spaces.
* moved tag file handling code into TagFiles.java
* add TagStack dockable
  - added TagStack.java, TagStackModel.java, & StackPosition.java
  - moved tag stack position handling into TagsPlugin.java
* removed getProperty methods from Tags.java
* make StackPosition.goTo work with closed buffers and handle pending i/o
* StackPostions release Buffer and Position referenced when a buffer is closed
* added NO_REPEAT to most actions
* added 'Push Position onto Tag Stack' action
* made 'Enabled' column in tag index files table in Option panel smaller
* TagFile.setEnabled() was broken (I broke it)
* Fixed bug with popping positions for open buffers off the Tag Stack
* removed tags\TagsCmdLine.java
* re-added tags\TagsCmdLine.java at Ken's request
* re-added Tags.setJEditAvailable(boolean)
* tag index file for current buffer can't be removed disable/enable
  in the table, because it puts it out of sync with the othe controls.
  When you click to enabled it, it adds another copy.
* removed Tags.getFuncNameUnderCursorOld()
* Fixed bug finding tag index file in parent directories.
* removed StackPosition.getPosition()
* updated TagStack popup menu to use TagsPlugin.popPosition()
* request focus for ChooseTagListDialog after it's shown -- fixes
  focus not being moved on my gentoo linux box.
* changed options.tags.tag-search-current-buff-tag-file default to True.
* removed StackPosition.getBuffer() -- doing path comparisons instead 
  of buffer comparisions for releasing positions.
  StackPosition.releaseBuffer() -> StackPosition.releasePosition()
* sequential duplicate positions won't be pushed onto the tag stack
* fixed off by 1 error in StackPosition.goTo when a buffer had
  to be opened.
* Locations for tags followed are now added to the TagStack, so
  2 positions are added for each jump.
* Current cursor position is now an implicit position on the top
  of the TagStack.  If not sitting at the position of the topmost
  element on the TagStack, that's where the cursor is moved when
  popping, otherwise the topmost element is popped.
* Changed label of `Pop Tag` to `Pop Position`.

* Fixed NPE when following a Tag before a Search has ever been done
  (was trying to restore a null value)
* Fixed passing null to GUIUtilities.showVFSBrowserDialog.
