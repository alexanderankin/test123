/**
 * The base class for all Launchers, extending jEdit's action base class
 * {@link EditAction}. All Launchers must extend this abstract class.
 * <p>
 * A Launcher encapsulate the logic of launching one or more resources
 * within its {@link #launch(View, Object)} method. The object passed
 * as parameter represents the resource to be launched (e.g. the
 * selected file). The resource can be of any type, including array and
 * {@link Collection}, however a Launcher can only apply its logic to a
 * type it supports. Therefore one of the first thing done in the
 * {@link #canLaunch(Object)} is to resolve the type of the resource to
 * something it can launch, which most of the time should be a file.
 * When resolving the resource to a {@link File} or {@link URI}, one
 * can use the various <code>resolveTo</code> methods from the
 * {@link LauncherUtils} class.
 * <p>
 * If possible a Launcher should be designed in a way that makes it autonomous,
 * so that all is needed to use it is to instantiate it and call its
 * {@link #launch(View, Object)} method. Moreover, like most
 * {@link EditAction}s, Launchers are typically stateless: the same instance
 * can be reused across multiple launches.
 * <p>
 * However the way in which the super class {@link JEditAbstractEditAction}
 * is coded shows that it stores a <code>Object[]</code> initialized via
 * constructor and overwritten with the argument passed to
 * {@link JEditAbstractEditAction#invoke(View, Object[])}.
 * That method is final and is just a delegation to
 * {@link JEditAbstractEditAction#invoke(View)}, so it's not really clear
 * whether these objects are meant to be parameters for the action
 * logic. In fact, {@link EditAction#getLabel()} uses them to compute the
 * label by giving them as parameters to
 * {@link jEdit#getProperty(String, Object[])}.
 * <p>
 * Therefore in order to avoid this stateful/stateless ambiguity, Launchers
 * are implemented to be stateless by default. Unless the relevant contructor
 * is used to mark it as stateful, the use of state-related methods such as 
 * {@link #setResource(Object)}, {@link #getResource()}, {@link #launch(View)},
 * and {@link #invoke(View)} will throw an {@link IllegalStateException}.
 * Also the default implementation of {@link EditAction#getLabel()} and
 * {@link EditAction#getName()} are reused, therefore the name of a
 * Launcher is used as prefix to build the name of the property storing its
 * label (&lt;name&gt;.label). This also means the label property can be
 * parameterized as supported by {@link jEdit#getProperty(String, Object[])}.
 * The methods {@link #getLabel()} and {@link #getShortLabel()} are the only
 * ones using the <code>Object[]</code> argument passed to the constructor.
 * Sublasses are free to override these methods and specify their own
 * convention for what the <code>Object[]</code> parameter should contain.
 * <p>
