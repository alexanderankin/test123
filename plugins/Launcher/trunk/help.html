<h1>Introduction</h1>

The Launcher plugin provides a way to add the same context specific menu
to the File System Browser, ProjectViewer, Plugin Menu, and text area
contextual menu. The contents of this menu is dynamic and depends on
the current selection or buffer. This menu offers various ways of launching
the selected resource.
<br>
For example: launch with associated application as defined by the desktop,
launch in browser, execute file, launch with associated application as
defined in the Launcher options, etc.
<br>
<br>
More precisely the Launcher plugin proposes a framework for defining Launchers
and managing them via LauncherTypes. Both of these classes are services
whereby other plugins can contribute new Launchers and LauncherTypes.
<br>Launchers are an extension of the EditAction type. They are typically
stateless therefore the same instance is reused in different places.
LauncherTypes manage a set of Launchers that:
<li>launch the same type of resource (files, url, etc.)
<li>share the same configuration information and intented action
<br>Note that the same Launcher can be used by many LauncherTypes.
<br>
<br>
For example on most systems one can find a command line tool
that is able to open a file with its associated application and
also open a url with the default browser (desktop settings).
On x11 system this application is 'xdg-open', on Mac OS X 'open', and
on Windows 'start'. At startup the Launcher plugin determines which
OS is being used and defines the corresponding
SystemApplicationOrBrowserLauncher. The latter will then be used by
BrowserLauncherType and SystemApplicationLauncherType.
