<h1>OCR documentation</h1>
Written by Shlomy Reinstein, June/July 2009.

<h2>Description</h2>

The OCR plugin provides an interface to the
<a href="http://jocr.sourceforge.net"> GOCR tool</a> - an OCR (Optical Character
Recognition) program, developed under the GNU Public License.
The plugin provides actions to:
- Extract text from a picture file (PBM format).
- Take a screen capture and extract text from a selected rectangle in it.
The extracted text is then imported into a new, untitled buffer.

<h2>Setup</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Get the GOCR binary for your operating system. You can find binaries for
  download on the <a href="http://jocr.sourceforge.net">GOCR website</a>.
  Set the path to the GOCR executable in the plugin option pane.
  <li>If you want to use the screen capture action, you need a converter from
  PNG image format to PPM image format, because the plugin saves the screen
  captures in PNG format, and GOCR is not capable of reading this format.<br>
  One such converter is "gbmconv", which can be downloaded from the
  <a href="http://heikon.home.tlink.de/">GBM website</a>, but any other command-line
  converter can be used as well. The converter should take 2 arguments, the PNG file
  to convert, and the output PPM file to create.<br>
  Set the path to the converter executable in the plugin option pane.
</ul>

<h2>Tips...</h2>

I've found out that GOCR tends to produce bad results with small / normal fonts,
but very good results with large fonts. If you get bad results using this plugin,
try increasing the font size gradually until you get satisfying results. Sometimes
you may find that you need to use VERY LARGE fonts for GOCR to work properly.

<h2>Feedback</h2>

For bug reports and feature requests, please use the
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/jedit/support">SourceForge tracker for
jEdit</a>.
For other plugin-related matters (suggestions / questions), please contact me at
<a href="mailto://sreinst1@gmail.com">sreinst1@gmail.com</a>.

I am not an expert in OCR, and I'm also not very familiar with GOCR. If you can
help me improve this plugin by providing information about GOCR, such as how to make
it work with JPG/PNG/BMP files directly, or how to get it to produce good results
using small / normal font sizes, please contact me.

<h3>Enjoy!</h3>
