        <p>This plugin provides the clang-format source code formatter as a 
        Beauty plugin beautifier by running the external clang-format tool.
        clang-format supports C, C++, and Objective-C, and with the right 
        settings can also format Java and Javascript.</p>

        <h3 id="setup" style="background:#7FB2FF">Set Up</h3>
        <p>
        <b>The clang-format tool must be installed before using this plugin!</b> 
        </p>
        <p>
        Details for downloading and installing this tool can be found at 
        <a href="http://llvm.org/releases/download.html">http://llvm.org/releases/download.html</a>. 
        The clang tools are available for Windows, Mac, Linux, and BSD.
        </p>
        
        <h3 id="configuration" style="background:#7FB2FF">Configuration</h3>
        <p>
         The plugin is configured via the CLangBeauty option pane. Go to 
         Plugins - Plugin Options - CLangBeauty to select the clang-format executable.
        </p>
        <p>
         Next, configure the Beauty plugin to use the CLangBeauty plugin to format the appropriate file types:
        <ol>
         <li>open the plugin options (Plugins / Plugin Options)</li>
         <li>go to the Beauty > Modes pane</li>
         <li>choose clang-format for C, C++, and Objective-C modes</li>
         </ol>
         </p>
         <p>
         Additionally, CLangBeauty provides a dockable panel to allow viewing and 
         setting formatting options. Due to the size of the dockable, it is 
         best used as either a floating window or docked at the bottom. Go to
         Utilities - Global Options - Docking to set up the dockable panel.
        </p>
        
       <h3 id="usage" style="background:#7FB2FF">Usage</h3>
       <p>
         To format the current buffer, go to Plugins > Beauty > Beautify Buffer.
         </p>
         <p>
         See the Beauty plugin documentation for addtional details for setting 
         keyboard shortcuts.
         </p>
         <p>
         The dockable displays all the options supported by clang-format. The
         values displayed are from the .clang-format file found for the current
         buffer. The .clang-format file is found by starting with the path of
         the current buffer then searching upwards through parent directories
         until a .clang-format file is found. 
         </p>
         <p>
         The "Open" button allows choosing and loading a .clang-format file 
         into the dockable window. All of the available settings are shown 
         and can be edited and saved. The saved file is always named ".clang-format" 
         and should be saved in a parent directory containing the files to format.
         </p>
         <p>
         The "Save" button allows saving the current formatting settings to a 
         ".clang-format" file. You can choose the directory in which to save 
         the file. Note that clang-format looks for ".clang-format" files in 
         parent directories of the files it is to format, and will only use the
         settings found in that file, which may not be what is currently displayed
         in the dockable panel.
         </p>
         <p>
         Using the "Open" and "Save" buttons makes it easy to open a .clang-format 
         file for one project, edit it, then save it in another directory for 
         another project.
         </p>
         <p>
         The dockable window also shows the path of the current .clang-format 
         file in use for the current buffer, and indicates the number of languages 
         that have settings in the .clang-format file. If there are multiple 
         languages supported in the .clang-format file, there will be a section 
         in the formatting settings for each language.
         </p>
