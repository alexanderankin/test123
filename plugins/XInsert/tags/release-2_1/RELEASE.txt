XInsert 2.1

Requirements:
	* jdk 1.2
	* jEdit 4.1

Announcement:
	Release 2.1 - added reference entries

Source:
	https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/jedit/plugins/XInsert/
	tag: tags/release-2_1

Short Description:
	Insert text clips and execute macros and scripts from a dockable tree. 

Long Description:
	XInsert will insert a section of code/text from a library into the current
	buffer, using a hierarchically structured tree view. It is also able
	to run scripts in a native format as well as BeanShell scripts and static
	Java methods.
	
	XInsert clips are inserted by double-clicking on the desired item in the
	expanded branch, or by selecting it with the keyboard and pressing <Enter>
	or <Space>. Two actions are provided that can be bound to keystroke
	combinations: One sets the focus to the XInsert tree to provide easy
	navigation without having to leave the keyboard; the other inserts the
	currently selected item even when the XInsert window is not visible.

	Clips are stored in a simple XML format. The place where the current
	selection should go is indicated with a '|' character. That way huge tag libraries can be built. In addition, XInsert provides comfortable access
	to jEdit's own Beanshell macros.
