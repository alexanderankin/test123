<h2>SynchroScroll</h2>
<h3>Dale Anson, Jerzy Urban, 2012</h2>
<p>
A plugin to allow syncrhonized scrolling between multiple text areas.
<p>
When you have more than one text area visible in a view (View - Splitting -
Split Vertically, for example), go to Plugins - SynchroScroll - Toggle
Sychro Scrolling. Then moving the scroll bar sliders for one text area will
automatically scroll the other text areas. Note that when synchro scrolling 
is on, ALL text areas in the view will scroll.
<p>
SynchroScroll has two modes:
<br>
<br>
1) Standard:<br>
In standard mode, the first visible line in each text area is the baseline
for scrolling. Each text area will be scrolled the same number of lines from
this baseline. For example, suppose the view is split into two text areas,
and the first visible line in the left text area is line 50 and the first 
visible line in the right text area is line 500. Scrolling down 10 lines in
the left text area will put the first visible line at 60, and at 510 in the
right text area. So standard scrolling means lines are scrolled the same
number of lines in each text area.
<br>
<br>
2) Proportional:<br>
In proportional mode, the files are scrolled based on the proportion of the
number of lines in the files. Suppose the view is split vertically into two
text areas, and the left text area has 100 lines and the right has 1000
lines. Then for each line the left text area is scrolled, the right text
area will scroll 10 lines.
