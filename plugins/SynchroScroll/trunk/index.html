<h2>SynchroScroll</h2>
<h3>Dale Anson, 2012</h2>
A plugin to allow syncrhonized scrolling between multiple text areas.
<p>
When you have more than one text area visible in a view (View - Splitting -
Split Vertically, for example), go to Plugins - SynchroScroll - Toggle
Sychro Scrolling. Then moving the scroll bar sliders for one text area will
automatically move the scrollbar sliders in the other text area the same 
amount. Note that when synchro scrolling is on, ALL text areas in the view
will scroll.
