<title>The Menu Editor Plugin</title>

The Menu Editor plugin allows you to rearrange the jEdit menu
(File/Edit/Search...), shown at the top of each view. You can
rearrange the items in each menu, remove items from a menu,
or add items to a menu.
</p>
<p>
The plugin provides a single dialog, which you can open using
the plugin menu. The dialog shows the current menus on the left,
and the available actions on the right. For each of the two,
there is a combo-box at the top using which you choose the menu
or action set, and a list below it showing the items of the
selected menu or the actions in the selected action set.
</p>
<p>
To re-order items in a specific menu, select the items you want
to move (multiple selection is allowed) and either use
the up/down buttons to move them, or drag them to the
desired position in the list.
</p>
<p>
To remove items from a menu, select the items, and click the
right-arrow button, or simply drag them outside the list.
</p>
<p>
To add actions to a menu, select the actions from the list on
the right, and either click the left-arrow button or simply
drag them to the list of menu items.
