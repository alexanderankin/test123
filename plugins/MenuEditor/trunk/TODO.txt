To do:
- Show also the actual text of each action in the "Available actions"
  part. Sometimes "New" doesn't mean much - new view, new buffer,
  new dockable instance?
- Allow adding menu separators.
- Allow adding new menus (not menu items).
- Use a single menu item rather than the plugin's menu with a single item.
