<p>
The Menu Editor plugin allows you to rearrange the jEdit menu
(File/Edit/Search...), shown at the top of each view. You can
rearrange the items in each menu, remove items from a menu,
or add items to a menu.
</p>
<p>
The plugin provides a single dialog, which you can open using
the plugin menu. The dialog shows the current menus on the left,
and the available actions on the right. For each of the two,
there is a combo-box at the top using which you choose the menu
or action set, and a list below it showing the items of the
selected menu or the actions in the selected action set.
</p>
<p>
To re-order items in a specific menu, select the items you want
to move (multiple selection is allowed) and either use
the up/down buttons to move them, or drag them to the
desired position in the list.
</p>
<p>
To remove items from a menu, select the items, and click the
right-arrow button, or simply drag them outside the list.
</p>
<p>
To add actions to a menu, select the actions from the list on
the right, and either click the left-arrow button or simply
drag them to the list of menu items.
</p>
<p>
The buttons at the bottom of the dialog:
<ul>
<li>Ok: Apply the changes made in this dialog and close the
dialog.
<li>Apply: Apply the changes made in this dialog, but keep
the dialog open for making more changes.
<li>Cancel: Discard the changes made in this dialog (since
the last time you clicked Apply, if you did) and close the
dialog.
<li>Restore default: Restore the menus to their original
contents (the way they are provided with jEdit, with no
modifications), and keep the dialog open for making
changes.
</ul>
</p>
<p>
The plugin stores the list of changes that were made to the
menus, and re-applies them each time jEdit is started. This
way, you don't miss changes made by future versions of
jEdit (such as new menu items).
