To do:
- Show also the actual text of each action in the "Available actions"
  part. Sometimes "New" doesn't mean much - new view, new buffer,
  new dockable instance?
+ Allow adding menu separators.
--> Allow adding new menus (not menu items).
  * applyDiff should also work on the menu bar.
+ Use a single menu item rather than the plugin's menu with a single item.
