<h1> jEdit SSH Console Plugin </h1>
<h2> Alan Ezust, alan dot ezust at gmail dot com </h2>
<h3> $Date$ </h3>

<p> This plugin is designed to allow you to easily compile files you are editing
remotely via <tt>sftp://</tt> and parse the errors for ErrorList. It has no user
interface of its own, because it is an extension of three other plugins:
Console, FTP, and ErrorList, and uses a docked jEdit File System Browser for
navigation. </p>

<p> Console provides jEdit with a dockable command line interface to the System
Shell and the BeanShell, and an open interface for adding new shells. SshConsole
adds a jEdit Shell Service to Console called <tt>ssh</tt>. </p>

<p> Console parses the output of the commands through its own error parsers
which are configurable from <tt>Plugin Options - Console - Error Parsers</tt>.
When Console adds detected errors to the ErrorList dockable, you can click on
the error, and jEdit will open the remote file for you if necessary, and
position your caret at the error location. </p>

<p> The FTP plugin defines a virtual file system (VFS) called "sftp://", which
allows the user to make secure <tt>sftp://</tt> connections to remote hosts, and
browse their file systems using jEdit's File System Browser, also known as FSB
or VFSBrowser. At any time, the user can select, and then manipulate selected
files from the FSB or jEdit. Since the FTP plugin handles prompting and
remembering username/passwords, the SshConsole plugin assumes you want to
<tt>ssh</tt> into the same host using the same port and creds as the most recent
<tt>sftp://</tt> connection in that View's FSB (or its currently editing buffer,
if it is open to a file on a remote host via sftp). </p>



<h2> Instructions for use: </h2>

<p> Initially, the SshConsole does not know where to connect. If you active the Console
and select the "Ssh" shell from the combobox, you will initially see a
prompt like this: </p>

<pre>
[no sftp:// connections?] >
</pre>

<p> At this point, any commands you type will be ignored. To tell the plugin to
connect somewhere, you need to do one of these things: </p>

<ol>
<li> Plugins - SshConsole - Open From Secure FTP server - you can choose a file after
connecting. </li>
<li> Navigate to a remote file via a docked File System Browser </li>
<li> Edit a remote file in the current View's EditPane. </li>
</ol>

<p> After that, type something in the console, and you will see
your response from the server's shell. </p>

<p> Here are instructions for first-time users: </p>

<ol>


<li> Dock an FSB: <tt>Utilities - File System Browser </tt>. I suggest docking
it on your left. </li>

<li> With FSB: navigate to a remote host by entering a path that begins with
<tt>sftp://</tt>. </li>


<li> If this is your first time connecting, Enter your
user/password/key/passphrase there. </li>

<li> After you're connected, if you plan to connect often to this host,
     <b>Favorites - Add to Favorites</b> from the FSB. </li>

<li> With FSB: click on (or open) the remote file that you want to compile. </li>

<li> <tt>Plugins - SshConsole - Show SshConsole</tt> </li>

<li> Enter commands in the ssh console. Initially, it will connect and show you
the message of the day. </li>

<li> Click on folders or files in the FSB. Notice the "cd" commands that get sent
over to the remote machine in response. </li>

<li> Compile something with errors in it. </li>

<li> Look at the ErrorList dockable. Click on an error in the dockable. </li>
</ol>

<p> If later, you use the FSB to connect to a different remote sftp host, then
the next time you use the SshConsole, it should logout of the old ssh session,
create a new shell connection to the same host you just logged into via sftp,
and send your shell commands there. </p>

<h2> Job Control </h2>

<p> Sending Ctrl-D (EOF), or Ctrl-Z (DETACH), work the way you would expect them
to on a unix shell. To send a Ctrl-C, click on the "X" button in the Console
pane (Ctrl-C is still a "copy to clipboard" shortcut). Other control keys typed
during the execution of your program are <i>not</i> sent to the remote host. </p>

<h2> Built-in Commands </h2>

<p> The following built-in commands which work in the System shell also work in
the ssh shell: </p>

<ul>
  <li> <tt>%browse [<i>path</i>]</tt> tells your FSB to browse a given relative
      path, defaults to your current working directory. </li>
  <li> <tt>%edit <i>fileName</i></tt> tells jEdit to open given remote file as a
      buffer in the View's EditPane. Relative paths are possible here. </li>
</ul>

<h2> Troubleshooting </h2>

<p> If you are using "cd" directly to change directories from the shell,
it is possible the SshConsole will not realize this and think the errors are
from files in the incorrect path. Change directories using the FSB to ensure
the SshConsole knows where you are.
</p>

<p> Sometimes an ssh connection will timeout while you are using the SshConsole.
If this happens, you will see an <tt>IOException</tt> in your activity log when
you attempt to execute the next command. At this point, the console should
automatically close its existing connection and open a new one when you enter
the next command. </p>

<p> It may be necessary to click again on a remote file in the FSB, to remind
the SshConsole where to connect. </p>

<p> If for some reason, after a timeout, your SshConsole is non-responsive, you
can explicitly close all open connections from the <tt>Plugins - SshConsole -
Close Connections</tt> menu action. This has the effect of restarting the plugin
from scratch, so again, you will need to navigate to a remote file via the FSB
so that SshConsole knows where to send your commands. </p>

<h2> Future Ideas </h2>

<p> These are things I'd like to have in this plugin at some point, but I don't
feel like doing them myself. Any volunteers? </p>

<ul>

<li> Interpret or ignore vt10x escape codes for color changes -
     can we re-use code from <a href="http://www.jcraft.com/jcterm/">jcterm</a>?
</li>

<li> Check the FSB to determine if a "cd" is given a valid directory, and don't
call <tt>ConsoleState.setPath()</tt> to update the sshconsole's path unless it
is valid.</li>

<li> Use FSB and existing sftp:// VFS connection to calculate possible
completions. </li>

<li> Make the Console Commandos smarter, so that they can execute in the ssh or
System shell depending on the VFS used in the path. Perhaps add a VFS to Shell
Mapping feature of Console so that Commandos can work in other shell/VFS combos
too? </li>

</ul>

<p> Enjoy! This is free software, released under the 
<a href="http://sam.zoy.org/wtfpl/">wtfpl</a>. Feel free to
contribute to it (or other plugins) too. Start by joining the
<tt>jedit-devel@lists.sourceforge.net</tt> mailing list and submitting patches
or suggestions.
