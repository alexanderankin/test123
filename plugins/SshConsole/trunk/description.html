<p>SshConsole is an extension of the FTP, Console and ErrorList plugins
designed to execute commands on the same host, and in the same directory,
as the file you are currently editing or clicking on in the File Browser or ProjectViewer.
Uses the <tt>sftp://</tt> protocol and Console to parse the output for errors to show in ErrorList.
Makes it easier to compile remote files and quickly jump to the errors.
