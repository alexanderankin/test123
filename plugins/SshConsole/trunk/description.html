<p>SshConsole is an extension of the FTP, Console and ErrorList plugins. SshConsole is configured to execute commands on the same host, and in the same directory, as the file you are currently editing in jEdit via <tt>sftp://</tt>. It uses Console to parse the output for errors to show in ErrorList. This makes it easier to compile remote files and quickly jump to the errors.
