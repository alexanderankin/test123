<title> Introduction </title>


<para> This plugin is designed to allow you to easily compile files you are editing
remotely via <literal>sftp://</literal> and parse the errors for ErrorList. It has no user
interface of its own, because it is an extension of three other plugins:
<ulink url="jeditresource:/Console.jar!/index.html">Console</ulink>, 
<ulink url="jeditresource:/FTP.jar!/index.html">FTP</ulink>, and 
<ulink url="jeditresource:/ErrorList.jar!/index.html">ErrorList</ulink>.
It also uses a dockable jEdit 
<ulink url="jeditresource:/doc/users-guide/vfs-browser.html">File System Browser</ulink>
or <ulink url="jeditresource:/ProjectViewer.jar!/index.html">ProjectViewer</ulink>
for navigation. </para>

<para> SshConsole has no option pane of its own. The customizations possible
for this plugin are in Console or ErrorList options. </para>

<para> Console provides jEdit with a dockable command line interface to the System
Shell and the BeanShell, and an open interface for adding new shells. SshConsole
adds a jEdit Shell Service to Console called <literal>ssh</literal>. </para>

<para> Console parses the output of the commands through its own error parsers
which are configurable from <literal>Plugin Options - Console - Error Parsers</literal>.
When Console adds detected errors to the ErrorList dockable, you can click on
the error, and jEdit will open the remote file for you if necessary, and
position your caret at the error location. </para>

<para> The FTP plugin defines a virtual file system (VFS) called &quot;sftp://&quot;, which
allows the user to make secure <literal>sftp://</literal> connections to remote hosts, and
browse their file systems using jEdit's File System Browser, also known as FSB
or VFSBrowser. At any time, the user can select, and then manipulate selected
files from the FSB or jEdit. Since the FTP plugin handles prompting and
remembering username/passwords, the SshConsole initially tries to to
<literal>ssh</literal> into the same host using the same port and creds as the current
buffer's path. </para>
</section>

<section id="usage">
<title> Usage </title>

<para> Initially, the SshConsole does not know where to connect. If you activate
the Console and select the &quot;Ssh&quot; shell from the combobox, you will initially see
a prompt like this: </para>

<programlisting>
[no sftp:// connections?] &gt;
</programlisting>

<para> At this point, any commands you type will be ignored. To tell the plugin to
connect somewhere, and open a remote file. </para>

<para> Once you are editing a remote file, type something into SshConsole and you
will see your response from the server's shell. </para>

<bridgehead> Instructions for first-time users: </bridgehead>

<orderedlist>
<listitem><para> Go to <literal>Plugin Options - Console - System Shell </literal> and find the
section <literal>Events to Chdir</literal>. </para>
     <para> Ssh can also be considered a <literal>System Shell</literal> since it can be used
     for executing system commands. </para>
     <para> SshConsole always responds to <literal>When TextArea buffer dir changes, cd to
     it</literal>, regardless of the checkbox setting here. This will help ensure
     that SshConsole is always executing commands in the buffer's directory.</para>

     <para> SshConsole can also respond to the other checked events, (project
     change, or tree node selection) if you check those options here. </para> 
</listitem>


<listitem><para> Go to <literal>Plugin Options - Console - Error Matchers</literal> and disable all
error matchers that you do not need. Having too many or too general matchers
enabled here may result in false positives in ErrorList. </para></listitem>

<listitem><para> Show the dockable FSB: <literal>Utilities - File System Browser </literal>. </para></listitem>

<listitem><para> <literal>Plugins - SshConsole - Show SshConsole</literal> </para></listitem>

<listitem><para> With FSB: navigate to a remote host by entering a path that begins with
<literal>sftp://</literal>. </para></listitem>

<listitem><para> If this is your first time connecting, Enter your
user/password/key/passphrase there. </para></listitem>

<listitem><para> After you're connected, if you plan to connect often to this host,
     <emphasis role="strong">Favorites - Add to Favorites</emphasis> from the FSB. </para></listitem>

<listitem><para> With FSB: Open the remote file that you want to compile.
</para></listitem> 

<listitem><para> Enter commands in the ssh console. Initially, it will connect and show you
the message of the day. </para></listitem>

<listitem><para> Open a buffer in a different folder, or invoke a console chdir event.
Notice that &quot;cd&quot; commands get sent over to the remote machine in response to
certain events. 
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para> Compile something with errors in it. </para></listitem>

<listitem><para> Look at the ErrorList dockable. Click on an error in the dockable. </para></listitem>
</orderedlist>

<para> If later, you connect to a different remote sftp host and open a file from
there, then the next time SshConsole executes a command, it should logout of the
old ssh session, create a new shell connection to the same host you just logged
into via sftp, and send your shell commands there. </para>
</section>
<section id="projectviewer-integration">
<title> ProjectViewer Integration </title>

<para> ProjectViewer permits you to have projects rooted at a
<literal>sftp://</literal> directory. If you switch to such a project
and <emphasis role="strong">Plugin Options - Console - System Shell - <emphasis>On project change, cd to PV
root dir</emphasis></emphasis> is checked, then the <literal>ssh</literal> shell should be selected in
Console and the project root directory should be the current working directory. 
</para>

<para> The Console actions, <literal>Compile Project</literal> and <literal>Run Project</literal> also
automatically switch to use the most appropriate shell (ssh) before changing to
the project root directory, when building/running an sftp project. </para>

<para> Furthermore, the node selection events that Console responds to from 
the File System Browser are also sent from the ProjectViewer tree and passed
onto the ssh shell when the chdir event option is checked.
</para>
</section>
<section id="jobcontrol"> 
<title> Job Control  </title>

<para> Sending Ctrl-D (EOF), or Ctrl-Z (DETACH), work the way you would expect them
to on a unix shell. EOF will close the connection and terminate the
corresponding stream task. To send a Ctrl-C, click on the &quot;X&quot; button in the Console
pane (Ctrl-C is still a &quot;copy to clipboard&quot; shortcut). Other control keys typed
during the execution of your program are <emphasis>not</emphasis> sent to the remote host. </para>
</section>
<section id="builtins">
<title> Built-in Commands </title>

<para> The following built-in commands which work in the System shell also work in
the ssh shell: </para>

<itemizedlist>
  <listitem><para> <programlisting>%browse [<emphasis>path</emphasis>]</programlisting>
  tells your FSB to browse a given relative path, defaults to your current
  working directory. </para></listitem> 
  <listitem><para> 
  <programlisting>%edit <emphasis>fileName</emphasis></programlisting>
  tells jEdit to open given remote file as a buffer in the View's EditPane.
  Relative paths are possible here. </para></listitem> 
</itemizedlist>
</section>
<section id="troubleshooting">
<title> Troubleshooting </title>

<para> If you are getting lots of false errors in ErrorList which do not correspond
to filenames and line numbers, this could mean you have too many or too general
Console error matchers. Disable the ones you are not using from
<literal>Plugin Options - Console - Error Matchers</literal>. </para> 

<para> If you are typing &quot;cd&quot; directly to change directories from SshConsole, 
it is possible the console shell state will not realize this and think 
errors are from files in an incorrect path. Change directories using the chdir
events you selected in Console's plugin options. to ensure the SshConsole knows
where you are. 
</para>

<para> Sometimes an ssh connection will timeout while you are using the SshConsole.
If this happens, you will see an <literal>IOException</literal> in your activity log when
you attempt to execute the next command. At this point, the console should
automatically close its existing connection and open a new one when you enter
the next command. </para>

<para> It may be necessary to cause another Console chdir event before
the SshConsole &quot;wakes up&quot; again. </para>

<para> If for some reason, after a timeout, your SshConsole is non-responsive, you
can explicitly close all open connections from the <literal>Plugins - SshConsole -
Close Connections</literal> menu action. This has the effect of restarting the plugin
from scratch. </para>

<section id="futureideas"> 
<title> Future Ideas </title>

<para> These are things I'd like to have in this plugin at some point, but I don't
feel like doing them myself. Any volunteers? </para>

<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para> Check the VFS to determine if a &quot;cd&quot; is given a valid directory, and don't
call <literal>ConsoleState.setPath()</literal> to update the sshconsole's path unless it
is valid.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para> Use VFS and existing sftp:// VFS connection to calculate possible
completions. </para></listitem>

</itemizedlist>

<para> Enjoy! This is free software, released under a modified version of
