<p>GdbPlugin enables debugging programs using the gdb debugger directly from jEdit. The plugin provides the following functionality: </p>
<ul>
<li>
Setting/Removing/Toggling breakpoints directly in jEdit buffers.
</li>
<li>
Controlling program execution (the usual continue/step/next/...) - either using actions from the GdbPlugin menu or using a very simple GUI panel.
</li>
<li>
Visualization of breakpoints and the current instruction using icons in the gutter area.
</li>
<li>
Viewing/changing values of expressions and automatic variables (function arguments and variables defined inside the function).
</li>
<li>
Breakpoint dockable which enables editing breakpoint properties (conditions/skip counts/enabled state) and adding watchpoints.
</li>
<li>
Stack trace (normally called "backtrace" in gdb) dockable that enables you to view and quickly jump to the source code of selected stack frames.
</li>
<li>
Defining "launch configurations" - i.e. the applications to debug, their command-line arguments etc.
</li>
<li>
Two Console plugin shell services: "Program" for communication with the debugged program, and "GDB/MI" for controlling the GDB/MI process.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The plugin uses gdb/mi (for most functions) for the interface with gdb. The plugin is still under development; as such, it is incomplete and might be unstable.
