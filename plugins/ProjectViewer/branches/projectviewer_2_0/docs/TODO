- use JEdits VFS code to allow projects on virtual file systems such as ftp
  see:  org.gjt.sp.jedit.io.VFS (this would change things quite a lot!)
 
- Implement functionality from old version:
  * open in browser
  * open with external app
  * hypersearch in directories
  * expand/collapse all nodes
  * close files from current project (is it useful?) 
  * what else?

- Merge FastOpen into ProjectViewer (and think about a nice way to
  integrate the UI into the PV pane - or keep it separated?)

- Test: renaming of projects and directories; removal of nodes (all kinds);
  deletion of files.
