<body>Working with the Project Viewer.

<p>External plugins can interact with the Project Viewer plugin in various
ways:</p>

<ul>
	<li>By providing project specific properties: {@linkplain projectviewer.config properties}</li>
	
	<li>By creating new node types: {@linkplain projectviewer.vpt nodes}</li>
	
	<li>By creating node-specific actions: {@linkplain projectviewer.action actions} </li>
	
	<li>By listening to Project Viewer events</li>
</ul>

<p>In this document, we explain how to use Project Viewer events to track user
actions on the Project Viewer's interface.</p>

<p>The Project Viewer plugin provides a different interface for each open jEdit
view, so the user can work with different projects in different views. This is
useful for PV's purposes, but some plugins may not benefit from such a dependence.</p>

<p>For this reason, the event notification provided by PV can be used by either
kind of plugins. The 
{@link projectviewer.ProjectViewer#addProjectViewerListener(ProjectViewerListener,View)
	addProjectViewerListener()} in class 
{@link projectviewer.ProjectViewer ProjectViewer} provides a way for both types of
plugin to register for PV events.</p>

<p>Currently, the only event notification is for when a new project is loaded
into PV. This works differently for plugins that rely on jEdit's views and for
those that do not. For plugins that are view-dependent (which means, generally,
that there is an instance of some class for each open jEdit view, just like the
ProjectViewer class), these events are only fired when a project is loaded into
that particular instance of PV in that view. Changes in other views will not
fire any events for that listener.</p>

<p>For plugins that do not take into account the current active view, events are
fired more oftenly. Any change of the current project in any view will fire an
event for these listeners. Also, when the current view is changed (i.e., the 
user starts working on another view), an event is fired saying that the project
currently active in that view has been activated.</p>

<p>These events can be very useful for plugins that want integration with some
aspect of a project. For example, a plugin may want to display information about
some build file for the project, so each time a project is changed the information
displayed changes. Or maybe the plugin can use different properties for different
projects. For more complex interation with the ProjectViewer plugin, please
read the other documentation linked at the beginning of this document.</p>
