<body><h3>How to extend the Project Options Dialog.</h3>

<p>The ProjectOptions dialog has been designed to be easily integrated into
existing plugins without requiring the plugin to the deeply tied to the
ProjectViewer plugin. This means that a plugin may choose to extend the
Project Viewer's capabilities, but still be able to run without Project
Viewer if it's not available.</p>

<p>To achieve this, ProjectViewer uses almost the same API as jEdit to
build the OptionsDialog. In fact, the plugin's options pane itself can be
almost entirely reused to extend the project's option dialog.</p>

<p>It becomes easier if the plugin uses a "property" based configuration style,
just like jEdit provides by jEdit.getProperty(), or in the same style of the
java.util.Properties class.</p>

<p>By having your option pane query a method for properties (instead of
hardcoding jEdit.getProperty() calls inside your methods), you need only
to extend the option pane class and make the "getProperty()" method query
the project instead. For example:</p>

<pre><code>
class MyOptionPane extends AbstractOptionPane {

	// implementation...

	void myMethod() {
		//...
		String s = getProperty("property");
	}
	
	String getProperty(String s) {
		return jEdit.getProperty(s);
	}
	
}

class MyProjectOptionPane extends MyOptionPane {

	VPTProject p;
	
	String getProperty(String s) {
		return p.getProperty();
	}

}
</code></pre>

<p>So, virtually all the code is reused, just by creating a method for the
actual getting and setting of properties.</p>

<p>A second option is to use a java.util.Properties object to get/set properties
in the option pane. If called when the jEdit options dialog is shown, the method
jEdit.getProperties() return such an object. If called from the ProjectViewers
project option dialog, the VPTProject instance also provides a 
{@link projectviewer.vpt.VPTProject#getProperties() getProperties()}
method.</p>

<p>To make ProjectViewer call your plugin when showing the project options
dialog, make your plugin class (the class that extends org.gjt.sp.jedit.EditPlugin)
implement the interface 
{@link projectviewer.config.ProjectOptionsPlugin ProjectOptionsPlugin}. 
Every plugin registered in jEdit that also implements this interface will be
queried to create option panes for the project dialog.</p>

<p>Optionally, if you don't want your plugin to depend on ProjectViewer, you may use the
{@link projectviewer.config.ProjectOptions#registerPlugin(ProjectOptionsPlugin) registerPlugin()}
method to register your plugin in the properties dialog. This way your EditPlugin
class will not be tied to a ProjectViewer class and your plugin will be able to
work without PV being installed.</p>
