<body><h3>Creating custom nodes.</h3>

<p>It's possible to create new kinds of nodes to be inserted into a project.
Although not tested, all the necessary functionality is available. To create
a new kind of node, the following steps need to be taken:</p>

<ul>

<li>Create a new class that extends {@link projectviewer.vpt.VPTNode VPTNode}.
It's highly recommended that the NodeType for your node is not one of the four
constants defined in this class.</li>

<li>Create a {@link projectviewer.persist.NodeHandler NodeHandler} to handle
loading and saving of your node type. Don't forget to register the node handler
in the <code>start()</code> method of your EditPlugin implementation.</li>

<li>Create an {@link projectviewer.action.Action Action} that provides a way to
import new nodes into a project. Optionally, you may use the code available in
{@link projectviewer.importer.Importer Importer} to ease the importing of new 
nodes.</li>

</ul>

<p>These steps should be enough to create a new kind of node and make it be
automatically persisted by the ProjectViewer plugin with the corresponding
project. You may want to provide other actions to be executed on the given
node (by creating more Action subclasses), or implement the 
{@link projectviewer.vpt.VPTNode#open() open()} method of the node to specify
an action to be executed when the node receives a double click on the tree.
When implementing <code>open()</code>, make sure to make the <code>close()</code>,
<code>canOpen()</code> and <code>isOpened()</code> methods consistent with 
your implementation.</p>

<p>Implementing new nodes should be considered highly experimental, so bear
that in mind when going through this path.</p>
