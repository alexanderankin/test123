- Create a option pane that configure the properties in 'import.properties'

- tooltip on obscured items (project files should have a tooltip that is their
  path).

- Do documentation.  This is important as people are starting to get 
  confused on how to use Project Viewer, what open files are, etc.
  
- The file filter (on importing) should be obtained from jEdit

- RFE: When you "Right click" on a project you should have a place for 
  "Properties" (IE name and root) and "Re-import files" (IE check for any 
  new additions and re-add them)
  
- RFE: provide an alternate icon when the the file you are editing is dirty
