New project resources requirements.

REQUIREMENTS:

- String -> File resolution must be FAST.  

    REASON: when jEdit closes a file I can look it up fast and then set its 
            buffer to null
            
- Project -> Directory [ -> Directory ] -> File[] relationship.

    REASON:  Allows quick display of Projects
    REASON:  Allows fast directory traversal
    REASON:  Allows you to query the files within a Directory fast.
    REASON:  Prevents dumb API choices like 
    
- Project -> File[]  and Project -> File

    REASON:  Allows a query of every file in a project
    

DECISION
    
    - ProjectResources should handle enumeration of Projects, saving parsing, 
      dumping, memory indexing.
    
    - Project -> Directory [ -> Directory ] -> File[] relationship.

    
    - Project -> File[]  and Project -> File

        - Store this as cached within "Project".  It is obtained by traversing
          the Directory list and parsing them up.
          
        - addFile() will add to this list as well.

        
        
NOTES:

    - ProjectResources, Project, Directory, FileComparator, ProjectComparator,
      ImportFiles, and File should moved under projectviewer.resources

    - remaining projectviewer.* classes should move under projectviewer.gui

    - Final version of this with changes should be something in the .120 range.

    - Write a short test suite to parse everthing out, add records and 
      directories

    - add a context menu to refresh the current project
