- add Archive Project to package contents in jar/zip

- use JEdits VFS code to allow projects on virtual file systems such as ftp
  see:  org.gjt.sp.jedit.io.VFS (this would change things quite a lot!)
 
- Implement functionality from old version:
  * drag files from the tree to the EditPane
  * close files from current project (is it useful?) 
  * what else?

- Merge FastOpen into ProjectViewer (and think about a nice way to
  integrate the UI into the PV pane - or keep it separated?)

- Reduce memory footprint: keep track of "active" projects and remove nodes
  from inactive ones (freeing memory). (?)
  
- Working files TreeModel is still shaky... have to check AllFiles also.
  (Or is it????)

- when adding files the filter "Non-project files" should still hide
  backup ("*~,*.bak") files
