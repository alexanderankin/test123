- use JEdits VFS code to allow projects on virtual file systems such as ftp
  see:  org.gjt.sp.jedit.io.VFS
  
- use newer icons
  see: jEdit/org/gjt/sp/jedit/icons/

- The file filter (on importing) should be obtained from jEdit

- Ability to "refresh" a project and look for new files.

- Add a "close all" option.  This is different than jEdit's "close all 
  buffers"  as this one would just close all buffers within the current 
  project.

- RFE: provide an alternate icon when the the file you are editing is dirty

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Toolbar
  ** use new RolloverButton class in jEdit 4.1? (for ProjectViewer 1.0.4)
  ** remove "new project" -> add entry to combo-box "new project ..."
  ** remove button "remove all files", but add button "refresh project"
  
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

* ContextMenu
  ** Project
    "properties" (IE name and root)
	"re-import files" (IE check for any new additions and re-add them)
  ** Dir
    remove all files from project
    delete dir (and remove all subfiles from project)
    rename dir
    search in dir
    hypersearch in dir
    search and replace (global search and replace for all files in a project)
 
 ** Files
    remove from project
    delete file (and remove from project)
    rename file
    Preview in Browser - (requires browser executable property(set for JEdit) and urlRoot property(set for the project) 

  - Need to implement file/directory renaming
  - Need to implement re-import files (refresh project?).
  - Need to implement search/hypersearch in dir.
    
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Options
  ** for Tabs Files/Working files
    boolean : ignoreCase

* Tooltips
  ** when over a file
    display full path and size
  ** when over project 
    display their path).

* Add files
  ** via CVS/Entries
    if there is a CVS dir in the top-level dir then ask the user, if he
    wants to import files on the account of these information (and not
    via filtering)

* Behaviour
  * '=' icon should remove files below a selection, if there is any
    (isn't this icon going to be removed?)
