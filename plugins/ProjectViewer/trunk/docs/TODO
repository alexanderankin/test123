- Change the tree control to allow multiple single-selections.  This way 
  multiple files can be removed.

- Do documentation.  This is important as people are starting to get 
  confused on how to use Project Viewer, what open files are, etc.
  
- The file filter (on importing) should be obtained from jEdit

- Ability to "refresh" a project and look for new files.

- Add a "close all" option.  This is different than jEdit's "close all 
  buffers"  as this one would just close all buffers within the current 
  project.

- RFE: provide an alternate icon when the the file you are editing is dirty

* Add files
  ** via CVS/Entries
    if there is a CVS dir in the top-level dir then ask the user, if he
    wants to import files on the account of these information (and not
    via filtering)

* Behaviour
  * Remember open files, when switching projects
  * '=' icon should remove files below a selection, if there is any
