Problems:

- Reduce memory footprint: keep track of "active" projects and remove nodes
  from inactive ones (freeing memory). (?)

- In "Old Style Importer", should we ask for what to filter to use instead of
  just using the selected filter in the dialog?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Features:

- Implement functionality from old version:
  * drag files from the tree to the EditPane
  * close files from current project (is it useful?)
  * what else?

- project templates (using the Templates plugin, if available)

- add macros to the context menu

- Merge FastOpen into ProjectViewer (and think about a nice way to
  integrate the UI into the PV pane - or keep it separated?) (?)

- use JEdits VFS code to allow projects on virtual file systems such as ftp
  see:  org.gjt.sp.jedit.io.VFS (this would change things quite a lot!)
