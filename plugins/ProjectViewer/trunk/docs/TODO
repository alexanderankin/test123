Problems:

- Clean up projects not active when switching from "All Projects" mode

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Features:

- project templates (using the Templates plugin, if available)

- check if project contains build.xml
	- if yes ant-farm integration (context menu from project-root)

- version control integration
	- VC_Check: VC Plugins register a Hook that gets the project root and checks
		if that project is under version control
	- import filters (see importer/CVSEntriesFilter.java)
		- interface FileFilter
	- status in tree views
		- cvs status only for files
			cvs status -vR <root-dir>
		- possible states
			Up-to-date
			  The file is identical with the latest revision in the repository
			  for the branch in use.
			Locally Modified
			  You have edited the file, and not yet committed your changes.
			Locally Added
			  You have added the file with `add', and not yet committed your
			  changes.
			Locally Removed
			  You have removed the file with `remove', and not yet committed
			  your changes.
			Needs Checkout
			  Someone else has committed a newer revision to the repository.
			  The name is slightly misleading; you will ordinarily use `update'
			  rather than `checkout' to get that newer revision.
			Needs Patch
			  Like Needs Checkout, but the CVS server will send a patch rather
			  than the entire file.  Sending a patch or sending an entire file
			  accomplishes the same thing.
			Needs Merge
			  Someone else has committed a newer revision to the repository, and
			  you have also made modifications to the file.
			File had conflicts on merge
			  This is like Locally Modified, except that a previous `update'
			  command gave a conflict.  If you have not already done so, you
			  need to resolve the conflict as described in  Conflicts
			  example.
			Unknown
			  CVS doesn't know anything about this file.  For example, you have
			  created a new file and have not run `add'.
