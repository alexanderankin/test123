- Copy 'import-sample.properties' to '<jedit.user.home>/projectviewer/import.properties'
  if one doesn't exist.  This needs to be done before this plugin can go to
  production.

- Create a option pane that configure the properties in 'import.properties'

- Change the tree control to allow multiple single-selections.  This way 
  multiple files can be removed.

- tooltip on obscured items (project files should have a tooltip that is their
  path).

- Do documentation.  This is important as people are starting to get 
  confused on how to use Project Viewer, what open files are, etc.
  
- The file filter (on importing) should be obtained from jEdit

- Ability to "refresh" a project and look for new files.

- Add a "close all" option.  This is different than jEdit's "close all 
  buffers"  as this one would just close all buffers within the current 
  project.

- RFE: When you "Right click" on a project you should have a place for 
  "Properties" (IE name and root) and "Re-import files" (IE check for any 
  new additions and re-add them)
  
- RFE: provide an alternate icon when the the file you are editing is dirty
