- add Archive Project to package contents in jar/zip

- use JEdits VFS code to allow projects on virtual file systems such as ftp
  see:  org.gjt.sp.jedit.io.VFS
  
- use newer icons (don't forget to delete old icons from repository)
  see: jEdit/org/gjt/sp/jedit/icons/
  Create project : 'Drive.png', how does a project look like ;-) ?
  Expand list : 'ZoomIn.png'
  Contract list : 'ZoomOut.png'
  Open all : like 'Open.png', but having two sheets 
  Add file : 'New.png' / 'Plus.png'
  Import files :
  	1.) like 'New.png', but there pages behind each other
	2.) like 'Plus.png', but two of them
	3.) like 'Parse.png' / 'Reload.png', but would more look like refresh
  Remove file or dir : 'Minus.png'
  Remove all : like 'Minus.png', but two of them 
  Preview in Browser/Viewer : 'Run.png' or an Eye or a Monitor

- The file filter (on importing) should be obtained from jEdit
(maybe not!!!! jedit might not be able to handle .gifs, but I still want them in my project 
- RFE: provide an alternate icon when the the file you are editing is dirty
  (contra : jEdit is not doing it in e.g. FileSystemBrowser) -- done

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Toolbar
  ** remove "new project" -> add entry to combo-box "new project ..."
  ** remove "remove all files", but add button "refresh project"
  ** add "close all project files"
     This is different than jEdit's "close all buffers"  as this one would just
     close all buffers within the current project.
  
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

* ContextMenu
  ** Project
    "properties" (IE name and root)
	"re-import files" (IE check for any new additions and re-add them)
  ** Dir
    remove all files from project
    delete dir (and remove all subfiles from project)-- done
    rename dir -- done
    search in dir -- done
    hypersearch in dir -- done
    search and replace (global search and replace for all files in a project)
 
 ** Files
    remove from project -- done
    delete file (and remove from project) -- done
    rename file -- done
    Preview in Browser - (requires browser executable property(set for JEdit) and urlRoot property(set for the project) -- done

  - Need to implement file/directory renaming -- done
  - Need to implement re-import files (refresh project?) -- done.
  - Need to implement search/hypersearch in dir. -- done
    to get active buffer, use jEdit.getActiveView().getBuffer() -- done
    
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Options
  ** for Tabs Files/Working files -- done
    boolean : ignoreCase

* Tooltips
  ** when over a file -- done
    display full path, size and attributes
  ** when over project 
    display full path and summary (number of files).

* Add files
  ** via CVS/Entries
    if there is a CVS dir in the top-level dir then ask the user, if he
    wants to import files on the account of these information (and not
    via filtering)
