VERSION 1.0.3

  - Project parsing does not start at jEdit start up unless the the viewer is
    set to be displayed on start up.

  - Fixed NPE when a click occurs over a non-node port of project tree

  - Added 'py' (Python) extension to supported import extensions

  - Project directory are now sorted

  - Double click interval have been shortened from 2 seconds to .5 seconds


VERSION 1.0.2

  - Major rewrite of the plugin.  All features that existed pre 1.0.2 should still be
    valid, except for the bugs.  That also means that all previously noted changes
    may or may not be valid in this release.
    
  - Added drag and drop support to the edit pane.
  
  - Fixed bugs with tree node synchonization where the different tree views are
    not notified of changes such as additions and removal of project files, and
    the opening and closing or project files in the edit pane.
    
  - Tree rendering on file and directory additions should be faster because the
    trees are not being rebuilt on these events.
    
  - Project viewer will ask if you want to import a file if you save it under
    the current project's root directory.
    
  - The project viewer and project can will now generate events so that other
    plugins can interact with the current project.

  - Project properties will now be stored under <settings directory>/projectviewer.  The
    plugin should move old properties files to this directory, as well as rename them.
  

VERSION 0.095

  - (DONE) (SERIOUS) ProjectViewer *won't* open any files that it thinks are 
    subscribed but aren't actually open.

  - (DONE) anytime you double click on a file... and it fails to open or close 
      a buffer.... and it isn't the current buffer.  select it or open it.
       
  - (DONE) fix ProjectViewer so that it can get jEdit events and 
    unsubscribe/subscribe to new buffers.
    
  - within File.setSubscribed() have it keep track of subscribed files
    within a hashtable in ProjectResources.  This is a kludge but 
    reliable.  Then events can just enumerate through this hashtable
    instead of all files.  When a file is closed due to an event 
    setSubscribe(false) and remove it from the hashtable.
    

VERSION 0.094

  - (DONE) double clicking doesn't work correctly. 
  
  - (DONE) if you single click on an item that isn't the last item you double 
    clicked on... then set the previous double clicked item to null

  - (DONE) if you double click on a file... and it isn't the current buffer.  
    then don't unsubscribe it.
      
  - (DONE) (Behavior not noticed) Currently when you double click on a 
    "working file" it doesn't remove it from the current jTree.  How long has 
    this been broken?
    
  - (DONE) Add .css, .vbs and .js support.
  
  - (DONE) less chatty
  
  - (DONE) When the plugin is stop'd... save the Project Resources
  

VERSION 0.090

  - (DONE) Adding a single file for some reason sets it's starting record to 0
    
  - (DONE) NPE when adding file to a Project with no other files
  
  - (DONE) Adding new projects stoped working... problem caused with new 
    resources.


VERSION 0.089    

    - (DONE) "Folders" view is not getting rendered correctly.  It is missing anything 
      outside of the projects root directory and it is also just plain missing 
      things.

    - (DONE) There seems to be a timing problem where if you click on a file.. and it 
      takes time for jEdit to load and JBrowse also loads it that the jTree 
      won't highlight the selected node until everythign is done


    - (DONE) find out how to increase performance of initial rendering time of large
      projects... really slow right now.  maybe serialize it or increase the
      performance of ProjectResources

    
    - (DONE) nows threading off initial Resource parsing    
    
    - (DONE) File names are getting truncated by the jTree.  You will need to 
      build in a buffer...  something like 40% of the number of chars.

    
    - (DONE) increase performance when loading large project sets with tons of files.    
    
    - (DONE) if the user selects a project that is already visible... don't reload it. 

    - (DONE) Add an Open All button now that everything won't be loaded by default.    
    
    - (DONE) when loading a project or all projects... set the status bar back to
      nothing... since no files are selected saying that a file (or anything 
      other than a project) would be a bad thing.
    
    - (DONE) remove all references to "options"    
    
    - (DONE) (HIGH PRIORITY) Ability to sort files alphabetically.    
    
    - (DONE) Sometimes... after PV is loaded it isn't set to the foreground... do this
      progmatically so that nothing ever happens.
    
    - (DONE) Fix bug where ProjectViewer is not instantly visible
    
    - (DONE)fix status bar rendering... dirs should be like "/dir1/dir2/" (trailing
      file.separator and fiels should be "dir1/dir2/file.txt" (no trialing 
      file.separator)
    
    - (DONE)Project.gif added to cvs as binary
    
    - (DONE) move the jTree "contents" into 3 separate jTrees "folders" "files" and 
      "workingfiles".  This way nothing will need to get redrawn when moving 
      between projects and the jTree state will always stay the same.  This also 
      fixes my problem of not being able to have multiplle JTabbedPane tabs 
      pointing to the same object.  make sure expansion of nodes still works and
      that when you add a file to one jTree that the ProjectResources becomes 
      dirty and you re-read it.  The best way to bootstrap this is to take 
      contents and find out all access to it... then replace all that code with 
      getCurrentTree() with will return one of the three JTrees.
    
    
    - (DONE) everytime you go to working files... reload the view...

    - (DONE)when you unsubscribe from a file when in WORKING_FILES make sure to 
      remove it from the JTree.

    
VERSION 0.081

  - (DONE) getCurrentDirectory() does not work correctly when changing projects.  It
    looks like Project and files aren't changing the dir... this may be a 
    problem in loadProject() where it should call 
    setCurrentDirectory( project.getRoot() )
  
  - (DONE) Do nothing ever when changing projects.  This gets confusing when 
    projects and files are opened and closed.
  
  - (DONE)add a JStatusBar to the bottom of ProjectViewer
  
  - (DONE) make Resources static and synchronized so that it is totally thread 
    safe also... parse it out when the first Project Viewer loads up so that 
    future applications (IE JCompiler) can request projects, directories, 
    files, etc without loadup time.

  - should increase speed when working with multiple ProjectViewers in 
    multiple views.

  - should provide inter ProjectViewer adding of files and directories.

  
VERSION 0.075

  - (DONE) (RFE)when you double click on a file... it takes a second to react 
    to become bold.  Rewrite this so that you manually set it to bold and then
    open file file so reaction time is somewhat faster.
  
  - (DONE) Have getCurrentDirectory() return a Directory and not a String    
  
  - (DONE) (EASY) Get rid of the "Projects" tab.  It really is not longer 
    needed.

  - (DONE) (HIGH PRIORITY)MISC Buffer NullPointerExceptions
  
  - (DONE) BUG keep track of the opened (but not subscribed) files and close 
    then when you change projects.  This became an issue when I implemented
    multiple views.

  - (DONE)(BUG) if there are files within the projects root they are not shown.
  
  - (DONE) (HIGH PRIORITY) FEATURE:  Multiple views...  Just different ways to display the 
    JTree.  This includes: 
        Folder View - standard hierarchy view
        File View - no hierarchy.. just alphabetically list all the files.
        Open File View - no hierarcy.. just a list of open files.

  - (DONE) (HIGH PRIORITY) globalStringReplace requires JDK 1.2 because a 
    "replace" method is not available within JDK 1.1.  Try making you own 
    StringBuffer class by taking the necessary "replace" method from the JDK 
    1.2 StringBuffer.
      
  - (DONE)Remove "." Directory.  should be placed under the projects root.  
    When working on projects with mixed directorys the "." directory can 
    sometimes show up in the middle which looks very bad.
      
  - (DONE) (HIGH PRIORITY) Have a currently editing file.  This way if I am 
    working on "myfile.java" and change projects and then change back, 
    "myfile.java" should be the buffer currently selected.
      
  - (DONE) (BUG) set the cursor to busy when loading all files in a project.  
    For some reason this isn't getting set during the import of a file.
      
  - (DONE) Do Hierarchical directories:
      - instead of ./ProjectViewer
                   ./ProjectViewer/projectviewer

        do:        ./ProjectViewer
                      projectviewer
        
      - you might want do consider redoing the Resource datastore at this 
        point to be something like
          Project -> (1 to many) Directory -> (1 to many) Files 
                      Directory -> Directory
      
      
  - (DONE) (BUG) when loading a project... getCurrentDirectory() should be set 
    to getCurrentDirectory().getRoot()
      - patched the code.. see if it works.
      
  - (DONE)JTree enhancement... when loading the jTree use 
    jTree.getModel().setRoot()... this should allow you to have a method which 
    returns a DefaultMutableTreeNode depicting the root.

  - (DONE) (HIGH PRIORITY) Have a currently editing file.  This way if I am 
    working on "myfile.java" and change projects and then change back, 
    "myfile.java" should be the buffer currently selected.
      
  - (DONE) (BUG) show a busy mouse when loading projects...        
        
  - (DONE) (RFE) while ProjectViewer is loading set the cursor on view to busy 
    and then back to normal after instantiation.
      
  - (DONE) (EASY) Get rid of the "Projects" tab.  It really is not longer 
    needed.
      
  - (DONE) Project.getRoot() doesn't work under NT.  The reason is that "\" 
    needs to be escaped as "\\"

  - (DONE) Under JDK 1.2 Swing wasn't loading all the GUI's projectCombo 
    correctly
      
  - (DONE) (NT was escaping \ )(HIGH PRIORITY) (BUG) Under NT projects are 
    created fine but when you re-load then they don't load any files...  why 
    is this?
      
  - (DONE) Button bar Images corrupt under NT.  Try to get fresh ones not from 
    CVS.. could be a binary commit problem.
      
  - (DONE) Under JDK 1.2 JDialog was overloaded so that passing a "null" as 
    the first parameter caused it to be ambigious.
      
  - (DONE) (BUG) NullPointerExceptions are being thrown when clicking on 
    subscribed files.
      
  - (DONE) (just called repaint)(BUG) When changing the subscribed status of 
    a file... the JTree isn't updated to reflect it's current bold/normal 
    status.. you have to click on another leaf for this to work. find out why
    the GUI isn't getting refreshed.
      
  - (DONE) (BUG) When parsing projects... the first one is always discarded.  
    Basically this means that if you have 2 projects within your property 
    files... only 1 is loaded.  If you have 1... 0 are loaded.

  - (DONE) (BUG)if you choose to import a file... that is already within the 
    project, don't add it again. This will be done through 
    ProjectResources.addFile() rewrite it to add support for return a boolean.  
    On multiple imports (IE Project imports) you should just ignore this but 
    on singleton imports you should tell the user with a with a dialog that 
    their file was not added to the project.
    
  - (DONE) (Appears to be working now) (BUG) When "All Projects" is selected 
    and you try to delete a project it totally screws up... doesn't delete
    the project.
    
  - (DONE) "All Projects" should only browse files... not load them.  When you 
    select "All Projects" close the current project so that no subscribed 
    files are shown... then you can view subscribed files if you want.
    
  - (DONE)ClassCastException when trying to add a file to a directory when 
    "All Projects" is selected      
    
  - (DONE) Are Projects and their files getting mixed up?  It looks like when 
    you exit and come back in your files aren't setup correctly..  This 
    appears to happen when you have multiple projects and then add another one.

  - (DONE) When you are importing files during project creation.  On the file
      import directory prompt tell the the name of the project.
      

VERSION 0.060

    - (DONE) Removing a single subscribed file doesn't work.
      
    - (DONE) removed parse button
      
    - (DONE) BUG 4:  When you delete a project... remove all (subscribed) 
      buffers from jEdit
      
    - (DONE) Add an "Contract All" option that will contrct all the shown 
      TreeNodes.
      
    - (DONE) Add an "Expand All" option that will expand all the shown TreeNodes.
      
    - (DONE) Do not close all files when creating a new project... only remove 
      the files for a current project... if one is open.
      
      
    - (DONE) Keep track of opened files.  When you call Launcher.launchFile() 
      add it to ProjectResources via a new method.  ProjectResources.addOpenFile(File) 
      ( also a ProjectResources.removeOpenFile(File) and a 
      ProjectResources.getOpenFiles(Project) ). Then when you load up a project 
      via Launcher.launchProject() only open the files that the user opened last 
      time.
      
    - (DONE) when you select a project... don't close ALL files.  Only close 
      files thatare part of the current project.  This way you can edit specific 
      files outside any projects.

    - (DONE) Removed all extra logging code.      
      
    - (DONE) Move everything over to a Makefile
      
    - (DONE) When you double click on a <BOLD> subscribed file... unsubscribe to 
      it and set the font back to normal.      

    - (DONE) Single clicking a subscribed file selects the jEdit buffer...
      
    - (DONE) Double click subscription should only work for files... not 
      directories.
        
    - (DONE) When you double click on a subscribed file... nothing should happen 
      (IE don't load it again)
        
    - (DONE) HoldablePlugin no longer needed
        
VERSION 0.045

  - (DONE) Move the button action listeners into another class and their 
    action methods as well.
      
  - (DONE)Change the font for subscribed TreeNode's.
      
  - (DONE) Fix how I am handling views? ... currently I am just calling 
    jEdit.getViews and using the
    [0] reference.  This won't work for more than 1 window
      
  - (DONE)Project.setRoot() should not allow a root like this: "/tmp/"  They 
    should
    be with this format "/tmp" or "/test/tmp"  also "/" would be valid in this 
    situation
      
  - (DONE)... open all files within a project...
  
  - (DONE) No trailing file.separator on Directory nodes.
    IE "./ProjectViewer/" should be "./ProjectViewer"
  
  - (DONE) when adding a single file, start the JFileChooser from the projects 
    currently selected directory.  There should be a new method named 
    getCurrentDirectory() which returns the directory the user is currently 
    viewing.  This is changed when the user clicks on a Directory object.  
    If the user clicks on the Project object the directory will be set to 
    Project.getRoot().  If they select on a root node.  The directory should 
    be set to the default dir.  (thus getCurrentDirectory() would return null)
      
  - (DONE) When deleting projects... tell the user the project they are about 
    to delete.
      
  - (DONE) Move all inner classes withing ProjectViewer into their own files.
      
  - (DONE) BUG 7:    When loading files into from ProjectResources make sure 
    that they exist before returning them.  IE getFiles() (when loading from 
    disk) verifies that the actual file it is about to return a reference to 
    is there.
  
  - (DONE) Import "Makefile"s
  
  - (DONE) Clicking on "Cancel" when importing directories during project 
    creation causes a NullPointerException
  
  - (DONE) Make sure that duplicate projects can't be added.  With no project 
    adding "test" should work but if you try to add another "test" this will 
    fail.
  
  - (DONE) Improve parse generation speed.  Do not do the "project" substring gathering anymore.  Just try to count from 1 to
    the last enumeration and get the actual project file string.  When you get back null you know there are no more entries
    Also "break" at this point because there is no use in going through the rest of the Enumeration.
  
  - (DONE) loadProject and loadAllProjects should set the cursor to mouse_wait 
              
  - (DONE) PUT in comments about not editing the file directly... but if they do then "here is the file
    format"
  
  - (DONE) when creating a new project.. after the user has selected his root dir and is prompted
    to import... tell them the directory
  
  - (DONE) Optional directory for a project.  This way you can specify that /tmp is your
    home and then in the future when you add files to the project they start from 
    here.
  
  - (DONE) BUG 5:    When you delete a project... the JComboBox doesn't get populated correctly.
              The deleted entry should be removed.
  
  - (DONE) BUG 6:    (might depenend on bug 5) If you delete a project, the combo box does not 
              let you choose any more projects.
  
  - (DONE) BUG 8:    When you are importing files... and none are found... tell the user.
              Also tell them the total number of files imported.
  
  - (DONE) BUG 9: test out how files would be rendered it their directory were the same as 
    Project.root
  
  - (DONE) View files by directory
    - (DONE)currently working but when all files are removed from a directory, the directory
      needs to be removed.
