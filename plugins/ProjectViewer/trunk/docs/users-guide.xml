<chapter id="usage">
    <title>Using the ProjectViewer plugin</title>
    
    <para>
    The plugin interface consists of a tool bar, containing some command buttons,
    a combo box containing the currently available projects, and the project's
    views.
    </para>
    
    <bridgehead renderas='sect3'>What is a project?</bridgehead>
    
    <para>
    A project is a group of files. It has a name, a root directory, and optional URL Root.
    You may choose any file below this "root" to be a part of the project.
    
    If a project is intented for website development, setting the URL Root will enable 
    web type(jsp, asp, php, htm, html, etc) project files to be launched in a web browser.  
    Suppose the project "Root" also correlates to the URL "http://localhost/myproject/" currently running on a 
    web server, launching "hello.jsp" will launch the webbrowser (browser executable can be customized) with
    the URL "http://localhost/myproject/hello.jsp".  
    </para>
    
    <para>
    To create a project, click the "Create Project" button in the toolbar. This
    will show a dialog where you can enter the properties of the project you
    want to create. After you have chosen these properties, you'll be asked if you
    would like to import all files from the root directory. If you choose to do so,
    all files that respect the options defined in the Import Properties (see
    <emphasis>Customization</emphasis> below) will be automatically imported.
	Later on you can always add new files or refresh the fileset.
    </para>
    
    <bridgehead renderas='sect3'>The User Interface</bridgehead>
    
    <para>
    There are three possible views of the files on a project: the "Folders" view,
    which shows the files as if in a file manager, organised in directories. The
    "Files" view, which shows all the project's files in a flat list. And the
    "Working Files", which shows the files currently opened in jEdit.
	The files in the different views are colored according to the patterns and
	colors you have choosen for the filesystem-browser. Furthermore currently
	open files are highlighted by underlining their names.
    </para>
    
    <para>
    Optionally, by choosing "All Projects" from the project selection box, a
    alternative view is shown, which displays data from all projects.
    </para>
    
    <para>
    You can interact with the project in several ways. Double clicking on a file
    in the tree will cause it to be opened in a jEdit buffer, or, if the file
    is already opened, will cause it to be closed. Using the right mouse button
    will show options related to the current selection on the tree, allowing
    you to remove files or directories from a project, deleting them from the
    disk, or rename them.
    </para>
    
    <para>
    Right-clicking on a project will let you change the project's properties (the
    name and the root, for instance) and re-import files from the project's root
    directory. One note about changing the root: you're only allowed to choose
    a new root that is a parent of the current root of the project.
    </para>
    
    <bridgehead renderas='sect3'>Commands available in the toolbar</bridgehead>
    
    <para>
    The tool bar provides a fast way to access some of the functionality of the
    Project Viewer plugin. The available commands are:

            enter information about a new project. After creating a new
            project, you'll be asked if you want to import its files, and it
            will become the active project.

            a directory from which the plugin will look for files that comply
            with the Import Properties (see <emphasis>Customization</emphasis>
            below), and add these files to the current project.

            them files or directories. If a project is selected in the tree, 
            the project will be removed. A confirmation dialog is show when
            removing directories, multiple nodes or projects (but not when
            removing single files).
