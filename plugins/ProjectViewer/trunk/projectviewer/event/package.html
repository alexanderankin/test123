<body><h3>Event Handling.</h3>

<p>As of ProjectViewer 3.0, events are sent using jEdit's EditBus. There
are three kinds of event:</p>

<ul>

<li>{@link projectviewer.event.ProjectUpdate}: project-specific events,
which deal with changes in the project's internal data</li>

<li>{@link projectviewer.event.ViewerUpdate}: GUI updates, which deal
with changes in the plugin's user interface.</li>

<li>{@link projectviewer.event.StructureUpdate}: changes in the
organization of projects and groups managed by the plugin.</li>

</ul>
