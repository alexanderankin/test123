<body><h3>Event Handling.</h3>

<p>The Project Viewer plugin provides a different interface for each open jEdit
view, so the user can work with different projects in different views. This is
useful for PV's purposes, but some plugins may not benefit from such a dependence.</p>

<p>For this reason, the event notification provided by PV can be used by either
kind of plugins. The
{@link projectviewer.ProjectViewer#addProjectViewerListener(ProjectViewerListener,View)
	addProjectViewerListener()} in class
{@link projectviewer.ProjectViewer ProjectViewer} provides a way for both types of
plugin to register for PV events.</p>

<p>To register listeners for an EditPlugin-derived class called <i>className</i> using the new API, create the following properties:</p>

<ul>
	<li>plugin.projectviewer.<i>className</i>.global-pv-listeners:<br>
	the list of	classes that provide {@link projectviewer.event.ProjectViewerListener
	ProjectViewerListener}s for ProjectViewer that will listen to all PV-related events, regardless of the view where they happen.</li>

	<li>plugin.projectviewer.<i>className</i>.pv-listeners:<br>
	list of classes that provide {@link projectviewer.event.ProjectViewerListener
	ProjectViewerListener}s for specific views where ProjectViewer is being
	used. One object of each class will be instantiated for each view.</li>
</ul>


<p>Event notification works differently for plugins that rely on jEdit's views
and for those that do not. For plugins that are view-dependent (which means,
generally, that there is an instance of some class for each open jEdit view,
just like the ProjectViewer class), these events are only fired when a project
is loaded into that particular instance of PV in that view. Changes in other
views will not fire any events for that listener.</p>

<p>For plugins that do not take into account the current active view, events are
fired more oftenly. Any event being fired in any view will be sent to these
listeners. Also, when the current view is changed (i.e., the user starts working
on another view), an event is fired saying that the project currently active in
that view has been activated.</p>

<p>These events can be very useful for plugins that want integration with some
aspect of a project. For example, a plugin may want to display information about
some build file for the project, so each time a project is changed the information
displayed changes. Or maybe the plugin can use different properties for different
projects. For more complex interaction with the ProjectViewer plugin, please
read the other documentation linked at the beginning of this document.</p>

<h3>Project Events</h3>

<p>Plugins may register themselves to receive notification about changes to a project
instead of changes in the state of the ProjectViewer. To accomplish this,
the plugin class itself should implement the {@link projectviewer.event.ProjectListener
ProjectListener} interface, and register the listener in the project class.
</p>

<p>
The pre-4.2 way of doing this was by calling the {@link projectviewer.vpt.VPTProject#addProjectListener(ProjectListener)
addProjectListener()} method. Then, it was up to the plugin to detect project changes
and add/remove the listeners.</p>

<p>To register project listeners using the new API, create the following
property:</p>

<ul>
	<li>plugin.projectviewer.<i>className</i>.prj-listeners:<br>
	list of classes that provide {@link projectviewer.event.ProjectListener
	ProjectListener}s to add to active projects. Only one instance of each
	class will be created, and this instance may be added to many projects at
	the same time (in multiple views, for instance). ProjectViewer will take
	care of adding the listener to newly loaded projects and remove them from
	projects being deactivated.</li>
</ul>
