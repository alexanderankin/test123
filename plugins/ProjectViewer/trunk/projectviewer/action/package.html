<body><h2>Creating custom actions.</h2>

<p>ProjectViewer allows other plugin developers too interact with the file trees
by creating custom actions to be executed on the nodes. The actions are made
available on the tree's context menu.</p>

<p>Creating a new action is very simple:</p>

<ul>
<li>Create a new class that extends {@link projectviewer.action.Action Action}.</li>
<li>Implement the {@link projectviewer.action.Action#actionPerformed(ActionEvent)
	actionPerformed()} method to execute the desired operations.</li>
<li>In your plugin's <tt>services.xml</tt> file, add aen entry like the following:
    <blockquote><tt>
	&lt;SERVICE CLASS="projectviewer.action.Action" NAME="My Action Name"&gt;
		code_that_returns_instance_of_action();
	&lt;/SERVICE&gt;
    </tt></blockquote>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The menu item show in the context menu is provided by the
{@link projectviewer.action.Action#getMenuItem() getMenuItem()} of the Action
class. Subclasses are welcome to override this method to provide other kinds
of menu items (a sub-menu, for example).</p>

<p>Before showing the menu item in the context menu, ProjectViewer will call
the {@link projectviewer.action.Action#prepareForNode(VPTNode) prepareForNode()}
method in all actions registered in the context menu. This allows each action to
decide if it should be shown for the given node and what message to show, for
example.</p>

<p>Another important thing to notice in the prepareForNode() method is that
the actions should check is the node is of a certain type, and not if the
node is not of a certain type. For example, use "node.isFile()" and not
"!node.isDirectory()". This ensures that the action will not do anything
wrong if a different node type is added in the future to PV, or if another
plugin adds a custom node type to PV.</p>

<p>It's important to notice that the instance created by jEdit's ServiceManager
is not the instance used by the viewer instances. Those instances are
used as prototypes, and the viewers use {@link projectviewer.action.Action#clone()
clone()} to get instances for the specific viewer. After the cloning, the
{@link projectviewer.action.Action#setViewer(ProjectViewer) setViewer()} method
is called, so the actions have a reference to the viewers where they are being
used. This also means that you should not use the constructor of your Action
implementation to instantiate GUI components. Instantiations of GUI components
should be done lazily in the <code>getMenuItem()</code> method. The default
implementation already does this, so you should only worry about this if you
are overriding one of these methods.</p>
