<body><h3>Creating custom nodes.</h3>

<p>It's possible to create new kinds of nodes to be inserted into a project.
Although not tested, all the necessary functionality is available. To create
a new kind of node, the following steps need to be taken:</p>

<ul>

<li>Create a new class that extends {@link projectviewer.vpt.VPTNode VPTNode}.
It's highly recommended that the NodeType for your node is not one of the four
constants defined in this class.</li>

<li>Create a {@link projectviewer.persist.NodeHandler NodeHandler} to handle
loading and saving of your node type. Don't forget to register the node handler
in the <code>start()</code> method of your EditPlugin implementation.</li>

<li>Create an {@link projectviewer.action.Action Action} that provides a way to
import new nodes into a project. Optionally, you may use the code available in
{@link projectviewer.importer.Importer Importer} to ease the importing of new
nodes.</li>

</ul>

<p>These steps should be enough to create a new kind of node and make it be
automatically persisted by the ProjectViewer plugin with the corresponding
project. You may want to provide other actions to be executed on the given
node (by creating more Action subclasses), or implement the
{@link projectviewer.vpt.VPTNode#open() open()} method of the node to specify
an action to be executed when the node receives a double click on the tree.
When implementing <code>open()</code>, make sure to make the <code>close()</code>,
<code>canOpen()</code> and <code>isOpened()</code> methods consistent with
your implementation.</p>

<p>Implementing new nodes should be considered highly experimental, so bear
that in mind when going through this path.</p>

<h3>Registering a NodeHandler with the ProjectViewer plugin</h3>

<p>There are two methods of registering node handlers with the PV plugin. The
first one is to call the
{@link projectviewer.persist.ProjectPersistenceManager#registerHandler(NodeHandler)
registerHandler(NodeHandler)} method of the ProjectPersistenceManager class. The
second one uses a jEdit 4.2-style API for registering the handler. Just declare
a property named plugin.projectviewer.<i>class name</i>.context-menu-actions and
provide a comma-separated list of class names that should be registered. The
classes must extend the NodeHandler class.</p>

<p>Registering custom node handlers has one shortcoming: when your plugin is
unloaded, the classes won't be able to be garbage collected. This happens
because there's no safe way to remove the custom nodes that have been added to
the project and wait for the plugin to be activated again to create a new
version of that node with the new instance of the Class. So, the ProjectViewer
plugin will keep a reference to the custom node's class and to the node
handler's class so that it is possible to persist that node when the project
is saved.</p>

<p>If you develop custom nodes, you should keep this in mind to make sure
that this does not affect the newly loaded instance of your plugin.</p>
