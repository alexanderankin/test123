<body><h3>How to use project-specific options.</h3>

<h3>Custom Option Panes</h3>

<p>ProjectViewer allows other plugins to add custom panes to the
project's option panes, allowing for per-project configuration options.
To use this facility, plugins should provide an implementation of {@link
projectviewer.config.OptionsService} in their service.xml file.</p>

<p>Like for regular jEdit option panes and groups, set the
<tt>options.<i>optionPaneName</i>.label</tt> property in the plugin's
properties to set the label to be shown on the navigation pane of the
options dialog.</p>

<p>For an example of adding option panes to jEdit, you can look at the
source code of the "debug" plugin that is part of the ProjectViewer
sources, under the "pvdebug" subdirectory.</p>


<h3>Version Control</h3>

<p>Projects may be associated with a version control plugin. Plugins
that want to provide version control functionality to ProjectViewer
should implement the {@link projectviewer.config.VersionControlService}
interface.</p>

<p>The option panes for version control plugins are only shown when the
user chooses the plugin as the version control provider in the main
option pane for the project.</p>


<h3>Storing Project-specific Options</h3>

<p>Plugins may add properties directly to the project, without the need
to keep their own configuration file for the projects. The project gives
access to its internal <tt>java.util.Properties</tt> instance, for
compatibility with jEdit's properties so that as little work as possible
is needed to convert an existing <tt>AbstractOptionPane</tt>
implementation to work with ProjectViewer.</p>

<p>To use project-specific options, it is easier if the plugin uses a
"property" based configuration style, just like jEdit provides by
<tt>jEdit.getProperty()</tt>, or in the same style of the
<tt>java.util.Properties</tt> class. </p>

<p>For easier serialization of configuration data, take a look at the
{@link org.gjt.sp.util.PropertiesBean} class shipped with jEdit.</p>
