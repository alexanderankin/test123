<body><h3>The ProjectViewer Plugin API.</h3>

<p>External plugins can interact with the Project Viewer plugin in various
ways:</p>

<ul>
	<li>By providing project specific properties: {@linkplain projectviewer.config properties}</li>

	<li>By creating new node types: {@linkplain projectviewer.vpt nodes}</li>

	<li>By creating node-specific actions: {@linkplain projectviewer.action actions} </li>

	<li>By listening to Project Viewer events: {@linkplain projectviewer.event events} </li>
</ul>

<p>This document describes how to easily extend ProjectViewer by using jEdit
properties to export your plugin's functionalities to ProjectViewer, much like
jEdit 4.2's deferred loading API. Parts of the old API are still available,
but it is highly recommended to use the new API. It makes it much easier to
extend PV without adding dependencies on the plugin, and without causing
ClassNotFoundExceptions when PV is not present. The new API works with
versions of jEdit equal or newer to 4.2pre12.</p>

<p>The new API detects when plugins are loaded/unloaded in jEdit and updates the
extensions accordingly, so nothing has to be done by other plugin developers
aside from providing the service descriptions in the plugin's service.xml file.
When a plugin is unloaded, all extensions belonging to that plugin are
removed, so there is no risk of having stray objects being held by
ProjectViewer. (One exception to this is custom node handlers. See the
explanation in the page about custom nodes linked above.)</p>
