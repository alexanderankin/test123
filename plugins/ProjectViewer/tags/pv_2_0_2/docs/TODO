Problems:

- Reduce memory footprint: keep track of "active" projects and remove nodes
  from inactive ones (freeing memory). (?)

- In "Old Style Importer", should we ask for what to filter to use instead of
  just using the selected filter in the dialog?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Features:

- Implement functionality from old version:
  * drag files from the tree to the EditPane
  * what else?

- project templates (using the Templates plugin, if available)

- use jEdit's VFS to allow projects on virtual file systems such as ftp
  see: org.gjt.sp.jedit.io.VFS (this would change things quite a lot!)

- "reimport" should traverse directories not under the root looking for
  new/stale files.
