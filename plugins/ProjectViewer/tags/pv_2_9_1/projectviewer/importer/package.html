<h3>Adding custom file filters</h3>

<p>ProjectViewer allows other plugins to add custom file filters to the built-in
import dialogs. These file filters control both what the user sees in the
Swing file chooser and what files are imported when recursing into
directories.</p>

<p>To create a custom file filter, extend the class
{@link projectviewer.importer.ImporterFileFilter ImporterFileFilter}
and add an entry to your plugin's <tt>services.xml</tt> file.</p>
