<body>Extending the ProjectViewer Plugin

<p>External plugins can interact with the Project Viewer plugin in various
ways:</p>

<ul>
	<li>By providing project specific properties: {@linkplain projectviewer.config properties}</li>

	<li>By creating new node types: {@linkplain projectviewer.vpt nodes}</li>

	<li>By creating node-specific actions: {@linkplain projectviewer.action actions} </li>

	<li>By listening to Project Viewer events</li>
</ul>

<p>This document describes how to easily extend ProjectViewer by using jEdit
properties to export your plugin's functionalities to ProjectViewer, much like
jEdit 4.2's deferred loading API. The old API, described in the links above,
are still there, for compatibility with jEdit 4.1, although it's recommended
to update your plugins since it makes it much easier to extend PV without
adding dependencies on the plugin, and without causing ClassNotFoundExceptions
when PV is not present. The new API works with versions of jEdit equal or
newer to 4.2pre4.</p>

<p>The new API detects when plugins are loaded/unloaded in jEdit and updates the
extensions accordingly, so nothing has to be done by other plugin developers
aside from setting the properties described below. When a plugin is unloaded,
all extensions belonging to that plugin are removed, so there's no risk of
having stray objects being held by ProjectViewer.</p>

<p>Below, all references to <i>class name</i> mean the name of the main class
of the plugin.</p>

<h3>Project Properties</h3>

<p>To add custom option panes to the project properties dialog, the syntax is
the same as adding option dialogs to jEdit's option dialog. Just set one of the
following two properties in your plugin properties file:</p>

<ul>
	<li>plugin.projectviewer.<i>class name</i>.option-pane: defines the name of an
	option pane to be added to the project's option dialog.</li>

	<li>plugin.projectviewer.<i>class name</i>.option-group: a whitespace-separated
	list of option panes to be added to the options dialog.</li>
</ul>

<p>For each option pane, set the following properties:</p>

<ul>
	<li>options.option pane name.label - the label to show for the pane in the
	dialog box.</li>

	<li>options.option pane name.code - BeanShell code that evaluates to an
	instance of the OptionPane class.</li>
</ul>

<p>Plugins may add properties directly to the project, without the need to keep
their own configuration file for the projects. The project gives access to its
internal java.util.Properties instance, for compatibility with jEdit's
properties so that as little work as possible is needed to convert an existing
AbstractOptionPane implementation to work with ProjectViewer. As a bonus, it's
also possible to set "object" propertied, i.e., properties that are not
necessarily an instance of String. These properties are serialized an encoded
using base64 so that it's possible to save them in the XML config file.</p>

<h3>ProjectListeners, ProjectViewerListeners and Actions</h3>

<p>Adding any of these components is very simple. Just set the following
properties to be a comma-separated list of fully-qualified class names
that provide the desired extensions. You can add whitespace in the middle
of names to better organize your properties file if wanted (they'll be trimmed
by ProjectViewer). All classes must have an empty constructor, that'll be
used to instantiate the objects. The classes must be of the specified types
described in each property, or a runtime error will occur.</p>

<ul>
	<li>plugin.projectviewer.<i>class name</i>.global-pv-listeners: the list of
	classes that provide {@link projectviewer.event.ProjectViewerListener
	ProjectViewerListener}s for ProjectViewer that'll listen to all PV-related
	events, regardless of the view where they happen.</li>

	<li>plugin.projectviewer.<i>class name</i>.pv-listeners: list of
	classes that provide {@link projectviewer.event.ProjectViewerListener
	ProjectViewerListener}s for specific views where ProjectViewer is being
	used. One object of each class will be instantiated for each view.</li>

	<li>plugin.projectviewer.<i>class name</i>.prj-listeners: list of
	classes that provide {@link projectviewer.event.ProjectListener
	ProjectListener}s to add to active projects. Only one instance of each
	class will be created, and this instance may be added to many projects at
	the same time (in multiple views, for instance). ProjectViewer will take
	care of adding the listener to newly loaded projects and remove them from
	projects being deactivated.</li>

	<li>plugin.projectviewer.<i>class name</i>.toolbar-actions: list of
	classes that provide {@link projectviewer.action.Action Action}s that will
	be added to the toolbar of the ProjectViewer dockable. One instance is
	created for each class, and for each jEdit view the instance is cloned,
	and then the "projectViewer" instance is set for the cloned object.</li>

	<li>plugin.projectviewer.<i>class name</i>.context-menu-actions: list of
	classes that provide {@link projectviewer.action.Action Action}s that will
	be added to the tree's context menu. One instance is created for each class,
	and for each jEdit view the instance is cloned, and then the "projectViewer"
	instance is set for the cloned object.</li>

</ul>
