		<title>Presentation</title>

		<para>
			The ProjectViewer plugin allows to define groups of files as
			projects.
		</para>

		<bridgehead renderas='sect3'>What is a project?</bridgehead>

		<para>
			A project is a group of files. It has a name, a root
			directory, and an optional URL Root, along with other
			options that can be made available by other plugins.
		</para>

		<para>
			In this version of Project Viewer, the files in a project
			are not restricted to the project root: any file can be
			added to the project (or to any directory in the project),
			allowing you to organize your files however you find most
			convenient, independently of the file system layout. The
			project root and the files and directories below it have a
			special treatment not given to others, though.
		</para>

		<para>
			If a project is intented for website development, setting
			the URL Root will enable project files to be launched in a
			web browser. Suppose the project "Root" also correlates to
			the URL "http://localhost/myproject/" currently running on a
			web server, launching the file "hello.jsp" will launch the
			web browser with the URL
			"http://localhost/myproject/hello.jsp", if the file is
			directly under the root.
		</para>

		<para>
			To create a project, click the "Add/Edit Project" button in
			the toolbar, or choose "Add new project"  from under the
			desired group in the projects menu (accessible from jEdit's
			plugin menu of from the ProjectViewer toolbar).
		</para>

	</chapter>

	<chapter id="usage">
		<title>Using the ProjectViewer plugin</title>

		<para>
			The plugin interface consists of a tool bar, containing some
			command buttons, a menu containing the currently
			available projects (accessible through the button labeled
			with the current active node), and the project's views.
		</para>

		<para>
			To open a ProjectViewer window, you'll need to choose the
			"Open Project Viewer" action from the plugin's menu.
			Optionally, you can go to the Global Options dialog in
			jEdit, and dock the window in your favorite position (in the
			"Docking" tab). Note that activating a project or group
			using the plugin menu will not open a ProjectViewer window
			if one is not already opened.
		</para>

		<bridgehead renderas='sect3'>Organizing Your Projects</bridgehead>

		<para>
			Project Viewer allows you to organize your projects into
			groups. You can create as many groups as you with in an
			hierarchical manner, by using the "Add group here" command
			in the tree's context menu, or choosing the "New group here"
			entry from under the desired group in the projects menu.
		</para>

		<para>
			As with projects, it is possible to have groups as the root
			of the tree shown in the dockable window. For this, just
			choose a group from the projects menu to make it active.
			Some plugin functionality is not available when in this
			mode.
		</para>

		<para>
			You can also move projects and groups to other locations in
			your group hierarchy by using the "Move to..." command in
			the tree's context menu and choosing the desired destination
			from the displayed menu.
		</para>

        <bridgehead renderas="sect3">
        Switching projects with keyboard </bridgehead>

        <para> As you create more and more projects, you will want to be able to switch between them without using the mouse. ProjectViewer offers many keyboard-friendly ways of switching projects. </para>
        <orderedlist>

        <listitem><para> If you want to use standard Swing shortcuts and arrow keys to navigate through the Project tree, you should also bind ProjectViewer actions <guimenu>Open Parent Group</guimenu> and <guimenu>Open Group or Project</guimenu> to keyboard shortcuts (alt-up and alt-down suggested). While you are there, don't forget to bind a shortcut for ProjectViewer itself.
        </para> </listitem>

        <listitem><para>
        Each project and group gets its own "direct switch" action. You can bind these actions to keyboard shortcuts by selecting the <emphasis>ProjectViewer: Project Actions</emphasis> action set
        from the <guimenu>Global options -&gt; ShortCuts panel -&gt; Edit shortcuts:</guimenu> combobox.
        </para> </listitem>

        <listitem><para>
        The FastOpen plugin offers more convenient and/or mouse-free ways of switching between files and projects, and is an extension to ProjectViewer.
        </para> </listitem>
        </orderedlist>

		<bridgehead renderas='sect3'>The Project Views</bridgehead>

		<para>
			There are four possible views of the files on a project: the
			"Folders" view, which shows the files as if in a file
			manager, organised in directories. The "Files" view, which
			shows all the project's files in a flat list. The "Working
			Files", which shows the files currently opened in jEdit. And
			the "Compact View", which compresses subdirectories into
			top-level nodes, showing a structure similar to the java
			package naming.
		</para>

		<para>
			The files in the different views are colored according to
			the patterns and colors you have choosen for the
			filesystem-browser. Furthermore currently open files are
			highlighted by underlining their names.
		</para>

		<para>
			You can interact with the project tree in several ways:
		</para>

		<itemizedlist>
			<listitem>
				<para>
				Double clicking on a file will cause it to be opened in
				a jEdit buffer. If the file is already open, then
				ProjectViewer follows the FileSystemBrowser
				configuration option to decide whether to close it or
				not.
				</para>
			</listitem>

			<listitem>
				<para>
				Middle-clicking on a file does the same as
				double-clicking, except it will always close open files.
				</para>
			</listitem>

			<listitem>
				<para>
				The right mouse button shows a context menu with options
				related to the current selection on the tree, allowing
				you to remove files or directories from a project,
				deleting them from the disk, or rename them, among many
				other options.
				</para>
			</listitem>

			<listitem>
				<para>
				Dragging a file from the trees and dropping it on
				jEdit's text area will cause the file to be opened.
				</para>
			</listitem>
		</itemizedlist>

		<bridgehead renderas='sect3'>Importing Files</bridgehead>

		<para>
			Differently from earlier releases, the plugin does not
			follow the filesystem layout to organize files anymore,
			except for certain cases; notably, when doing the initial
			import from the project root or when adding a file that has
			been saved from an open buffer and is not currently part of
			the project.
		</para>

		<para>
			In the import dialog (available by choosing "Import files"
			from the right-click menu), you can choose any files to be
			imported to the selected node (the one where you clicked to
			get the context menu). The same filters available when doing
			the initial import for the project are available in the file
			chooser.
		</para>

		<para>
			You may choose any files and directories to import, even
			files and directories that are not "children" of the
			selected node in the file system layout. This allows you to
			organize your files in any way you want. You may even enter
			the name of a non-existant file in the file chooser: it will
			be treated as a directory, and even though the directory
			does not exist on disk, you'll have the same functionality
			for it as you have for other directories in your project.
		</para>

		<para>
			The file import dialog is a standard Java file dialog with a
			few added options to controle the behavior of the import
			process. These options are:
		</para>

		<itemizedlist>
			<listitem>
				<para>
				Traverse directories: if a directory is chosen to be
				imported, this option will cause all files and directories
				under the chosen directories to also be imported, as long
				as they fit the chosen filter.
				</para>
			</listitem>

			<listitem>
				<para>
				Flatten file paths: when traversing directories, you may
				choose to import all the files into a single node, insted
				of generating a directory tree.
				</para>
			</listitem>

			<listitem>
				<para>
				Import into new node: this will create a new node under
				which you are importing files, and all newly added files
				and directories will be placed under this new node.
				</para>
			</listitem>

			<listitem>
				<para>
				Filter settings: when traversing directories, you may
				choose from some existing file filters to choose the
				files to be imported, or create your custom file filter
				on the fly by providing globs for files to be included
				and directories to be ignored. For more information
				about the glob syntax, see "Import Options" under
				the "Customization" chapter.
				</para>
			</listitem>

		</itemizedlist>

		<bridgehead renderas='sect3'>Commands available in the toolbar</bridgehead>

		<para>
			The tool bar provides a fast way to access some of the
			functionality of the Project Viewer plugin. The available
			commands are:
		</para>

		<itemizedlist>
			<listitem>
				<para>
					Add/Edit project: shows the project properties
					dialog, where you can enter information about a new
					project. If the "All Projects" view is used, and no
					node (or the root) is selected, the "Create Project"
					dialog apperas, instead of the current project's
					properties.
				</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>
					Expand the file list: opens all nodes in the
					currently selected tree.
				</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>
					Contract the file list: closes all nodes in the
					current tree.
				</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>
					Add file to project root: shows a dialog where you
					can choose single files to add to the current
					project. Differently from the "Add files" in the
					context menu, this option will work as in the old
					Project Viewer versions, only importing files below
					the project root, and keeping the file system layout
					for files and directories.
				</para>
			</listitem>
		</itemizedlist>

		<bridgehead renderas='sect3'>Commands available in the context menu</bridgehead>

		<para>
			The context menu provides context-sensitive options based on
			the current tree selection. The following commands can be
			found in the context menu (some of them have already been
			explained above):
		</para>

		<itemizedlist>
			<listitem>
				<para>
					Add files: pops a file chooser from where you can
					choose any files or directories to import. These
					will be imported <emphasis>into the selected
					node</emphasis>, disregarding the file system
					layout. If importing directories, you'll be prompted
					if you want to do it recursively using one of the
					available filters.
				</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>
					Add files from VFS: lets you select files from a
					jEdit VFS (Virtual File System), such as FTP. If you
					choose local files, ProjectViewer will add standard
					files instead of VFS files. The functionality of VFS
					files in ProjectViewer is rather limited when
					compared to standard files.
				</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>
					Re-import files: this command will remove all files
					and directories below the project root, and re-read
					the file structure from disk according to the
					selected filter (which can be chosen from the dialog
					that pops up). It will also analyze directories not
					under the project root: it will re-import existing
					directories and remove stale files from "virtual"
					directories.
				</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>
					Remove from project: this will remove the selected
					node from the project to which it belongs. It is
					also possible to remove multiple nodes at once.
				</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>
					Delete from disk: this is only shown for files to
					which you have write permission. Choosing it will
					cause the files to be deleted from disk and removed
					from the project.
				</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>
					Rename: this will prompt you for a new name for the
					selected node. If you check the "Don't change name
					on disk" option, only the node name on the tree will
					be changed; the file on disk will keep its current
					name.
				</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>
					Archive project: this will prompt you for a file
					name. A JAR archive will be created containing all
					files below the project root.
				</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>
					Preview in browser: this will open the file in the
					configured web browser. If a project URL is set,
					files below the project root will be redirected to
					the given URL; in other cases, the "file://"
					protocol will be used. The part of the file path
					corresponding to the project root will be removed
					when opening the file relatively to the project URL.
				</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>
					Open with: this will open the selected file in a
					configured application associated with its extension
					(configured in the Project Viewer's plugin options).
					If no application is configured for the selected
					file, selecting this option will prompt you to
					choose an application.
				</para>

		</itemizedlist>

		<bridgehead renderas='sect3'>Using PV commands from jEdit</bridgehead>

		<para>
			Some commands are also available as jEdit actions so that
			shortcuts can be assigned to them. You can check all the
			possible commands available as actions by going to the
			"Shortcuts" panel in the jEdit options dialog, and selecting
			the ProjectViewer plugin.
		</para>

		<para>
			When executing a command using a shortcut, you may notice
			that sometimes no action is performed and an error message
			appears in the status bar. This means that the action is not
			available for the current selection in the tree. To check
			which actions are available for the selected node(s), check
			the context menu by clicking the node with the right mouse
			button.
		</para>

		<bridgehead renderas='sect3'>Third party plugins commands</bridgehead>

		<para>
			Project Viewer can be extended by other plugins; they can
			add properties to a project and define new actions for nodes
			in the tree. Consult each plugins documentation for

		<itemizedlist>
			<listitem>
				<para>
					Use external applications by default: if selected,
					files that are open from the tree (by either
					double-clicking or middle-clicking) will be opened
					using the external application configured for the
					file's extension, if any. If no application is
					found, it will be opened in jEdit. You can still
					open the file in jEdit by dragging the file node
					onto jEdit's text area. When opening in an external
					application, you'll lose support for auto-closing
					the file on project file, auto-loading the file when
					the project is re-activated and the file node won't
					be underlined, indicating it is opened..
				</para>

					it. Selecting "Once per session" will ask only one
					time during the time the current project stays
					active. "Never" will disable this feature. "Auto

		<bridgehead renderas='sect3'>Editing the context menu</bridgehead>

		<para>
			ProjectViewer provides an interface similar to jEdit's
			context menu editor, where you can add actions to be
			displayed in the trees' context menus. You can't remove the
			default entries in the context menu, but any action
			available to jEdit can be added. It's important to notice
			that adding an action to the context menu won't make it
			"Project Viewer aware": unless the action is specifically
			written to interface with ProjectViewer, it will work the
			same way as it would if executed from any other place (such
			as the jEdit toolbar or menu).
		</para>

		<bridgehead renderas='sect3'>File Associations</bridgehead>

		<para>
			The "External Applications" option pane can be used to
			register applications you want to use for specific file
			type, accessible through the "Open with..." context menu
			command for files. Just add a file name glob and choose the
			application you wish to use for that entry.
		</para>

		<bridgehead renderas='sect3'>Filtered View</bridgehead>

		<para>
			The filtered view allows you to group files according to
			their names. To create a filter, go to the Plugin Options
			and choose the "Filtered view" pane, or go to the project
			properties dialog and choose the "Filtered view" pane, to
			create project-specific filters.
		</para>

		<para>
			To create a filter, provide a file name glob (see jEdit's
			documentation for the supported glob syntax) and a name for
			the filter. If the "Show filtered tree" option is enabled,
			a new "virtual directory" with the filter name will be
			available in the "Filtered" tab of the ProjectViewer window,
			containig all file names that match the glob. Files that
			match more than one filter will be listed several times
			in this view.

			the file exists for each file in the project, which can be
			slow in some systems.
