<p>Jalopy is a source-code formatting tool for Java. It can insert and remove indentation, wrap lines, sort
imports, add headers, handle spaces, correct Javadoc entries to match method signatures and much more.</p>

<p>If your development team can agree on a coding style, Jalopy can help you maintain it, without any browbeating or
bloodletting.</p>
