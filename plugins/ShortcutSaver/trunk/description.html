<p> The ShortcutSaver plugin provides 20 configurable actions, allowing for
different key mappings for different edit modes. You can assign a default
action when no edit mode specific action is assigned, and assign multiple
actions to a single shortcut (shown in a popup list or run as a chain). </p>
