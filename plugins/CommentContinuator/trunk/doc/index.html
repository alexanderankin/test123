    <h2>CommentContinuator</h2>

    <p>The CommentContinuator plugin extends comments as you type them. Hitting
    enter in a comment extends the comment to the next line. If word wrap is
    enabled, when a wrap occurs the comment is automatically continued on the
    next line. The prefix character(s) of a block comment (the prefix characters
    after the first line) are extended also. For example, given the following
    beginning of a comment:
    
        <pre>
             /* a comment
        </pre>
        Hitting enter moves the caret below the letter 'a'. To start a prefix
        character, hit backspace twice and type '*'. From then on, when the
        comment is extended, that prefix is copied too.
        <pre>
             /* a comment
              * continued
              * to more lines. */
        </pre>
        The prefix can be any number of characters, as long as they are not
        letters or numbers.
    </p>
    
    <p>If a comment is automatically continued when you're done entering your
    comment, simply delete the line comment prefix, or close the block comment,
    and continue with normal text entry. CommentContinuator only works inside an
    existing comment.</p>
    
    <p>In addition to comment continuation, CommentContinuator includes a
    specialized format paragraph action that knows how to re-wrap most comments,
    or other text with a prefix.</p>
