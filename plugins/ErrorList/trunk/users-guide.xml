<chapter id="intro"><title>Introduction</title>

 <para>
  The ErrorList plugin displays errors and warnings
  generated by other plugins. It does
  nothing on its own; for it to be useful, some plugins that support the
  EditBus error API must be installed.
 </para>

 <para>
  The error reporting API is particularly well-suited to reporting compiler errors
  and such; plugins that use this API include Console, JCompiler, HTML and XML.
  If you would like to use this API from your plugin, see
  <xref linkend="api" />.
 </para>

</chapter>

<chapter id="window"><title>The error list window</title>

 <para>
  <guimenu>Plugins</guimenu>&gt;<guisubmenu>Error
  List</guisubmenu>&gt;<guimenuitem>Error List</guimenuitem> displays the error
  list window. This window is floating by default, but it can be made to
  dock into the view in the <guibutton>Docking</guibutton> pane of the
  <guimenuitem>Global Options</guimenuitem> dialog box.
 </para>

 <para>
  Errors are shown in a tree control, with each branch being a file, and each
  leaf an error. Clicking on a file will open that file; clicking on an error
  will open the file containing the error and move the caret to its location.
 </para>

 <para>
  The error reporting API supports two types of errors; genuine errors and
  warnings. The two are differentiated with different-colored icons in the
  tree; errors have a red icon, warnings have a yellow one.
 </para>

 <para>
  For keyboard-based navigation of the tree, see <xref linkend="actions" />.
 </para>

</chapter>

<chapter id="highlight"><title>Error highlighting</title>

 <para>
  The ErrorList plugin also highlights errors in-place in the text area with
  a colored underline. The color depends on the error type; genuine errors
  have a red underline, warnings have a yellow one.
 </para>

 <para>
  Hovering the mouse over a line with an error highlight will show a tooltip
  with the error message.
 </para>

 <para>
  Error highlighting can be disabled in the <guibutton>Error List</guibutton> pane
  of the <guimenuitem>Global Options</guimenuitem> dialog box. The colors of
  the underlines can also be changed in that same option pane.
 </para>

</chapter>

<chapter id="actions"><title>Additional commands</title>

 <para>
  The ErrorList plugin provides a few additional commands that can be bound to
  keyboard shortcuts in the <guibutton>Shortcuts</guibutton> pane of the
  <guimenuitem>Global Options</guimenuitem> dialog box.
 </para>

 <para>
  <guimenu>Plugins</guimenu>&gt;<guisubmenu>Error
  List</guisubmenu>&gt;<guimenuitem>Go to Previous Error</guimenuitem> moves the
  caret to the error immediately before the one currently selected in the
  error list window. If no error is selected, the last error in the list is
  chosen. This will open the appropriate file if the error is in a
  different file.
 </para>

 <para>
  <guimenu>Plugins</guimenu>&gt;<guisubmenu>Error
  List</guisubmenu>&gt;<guimenuitem>Go to Next Error</guimenuitem> moves the
  caret to the error immediately after the one currently selected in the
  error list window. If no error is selected, the first error in the list is
  chosen. This will open the appropriate file if the error is in a
  different file.
 </para>

 <para>
  <guimenu>Plugins</guimenu>&gt;<guisubmenu>Error
  List</guisubmenu>&gt;<guimenuitem>Go to Previous File With Errors</guimenuitem>
  opens the file immediately before the one currently selected in the error
  list window. If no file is selected, the last file with errors is chosen.
 </para>

 <para>
  <guimenu>Plugins</guimenu>&gt;<guisubmenu>Error
  List</guisubmenu>&gt;<guimenuitem>Go to Next File With Errors</guimenuitem>
  opens the file immediately after the one currently selected in the error
  list window. If no file is selected, the first file with errors is chosen.
