The ErrorList plugin displays errors and warnings
generated by other plugins. It does
nothing on its own; for it to be useful, some plugins that support the
EditBus error API must be installed.<p>

First of all, ErrorList manages an error list, which can be viewed by
selecting <b>Plugins</b>&gt;<b>Error List</b>&gt;<b>Error List</b>.
Clicking on a line in
the error list will open the guilty file and move the selection to the
error location.<p>

Errors and warnings are displayed with different icons in the error list;
errors have a red traffic light, while warnings have a yellow one.<p>

This plugin also highlights any errors in open buffers <i>on the fly</i>;
for example, if the console reported that Foo.java had an error on line 10,
line 10 of Foo.java would be drawn with a red underline (warnings are also
highlighted, but drawn with a yellow underline). Placing the
mouse over the offending line would display a tooltip with the error
message, as reported by the console.<p>

Other plugins can report errors by using the EditBus ErrorSource service.
EditBus is a system that allows plugins to
communicate and share information without being aware of each other's
internals.
