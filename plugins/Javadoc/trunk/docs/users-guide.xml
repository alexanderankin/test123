		The Javadoc plugin is meant to be a simple, easy way to quickly search 
		for api documentation. Simply populate the Javadoc list (Plugins -> Javadoc 
		-> Edit Search Settings, or Plugins -> Plugin Options -> Javadoc) with the roots 
		of your api trees, and you're good to go.
	</para>
	<para>
		To search the api trees, they must be saved to a local disk. The standard java
		documentation can be found at http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp
		(under Additional Resources, look for "Java SE 6 Documentation"), and the jEdit
		api should have come with your jEdit installation.
	</para>
	<para>
		There are two ways to search the api trees, and they both use unqualified class names
		(so don't include the package; it won't work).
		Plugins -> Javadoc -> Search... will open up a dialog with an input box requesting
		the name of the class to search for, and Plugins -> Javadoc -> Search word under cursor
		will automatically search for whatever class name the cursor happens to be over.
	</para>
	<para>
		This plugin uses the InfoViewer plugin to display the documentation, which can be configured
		in Plugins -> Plugin Options -> InfoViewer.
