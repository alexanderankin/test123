		<p>
			The ScriptEnginePlugin provides an easy to use and easy to implement framework that makes <a href="https://scripting.dev.java.net">scripting.dev.java.net</a> ScriptEngines usable inside of jEdit.
		</p>
		<p>
			It provides a ScriptEngineService which allows this plugin to pick up any ScriptEngines (installed separately) that are in other plugins.
			<br>
			<br>
			This plugin allows the evaluation of scripts from within jEdit's buffer, as well as using other scripting languages besides Beanshell to create jEdit Macros.
