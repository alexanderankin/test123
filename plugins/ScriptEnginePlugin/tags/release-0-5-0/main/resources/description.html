		<p>
			The ScriptEnginePlugin provides an easy to use and easy to implement framework that makes <a href="https://scripting.dev.java.net">scripting.dev.java.net</a> ScriptEngines usable inside of jEdit.
		</p>
		<p>
			It provides a ScriptEngineService which allows this plugin to pick up any ScriptEngines (installed separately) that are in other plugins.
			<br>
			<br>
			It also provides 2 convenient methods for executing the current buffer or executing the currently selected text. Both of these methods provide the standard macro variables in the ScriptContext making them available to any scripts executed.
