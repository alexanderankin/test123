About
=====

`ActionHooks` enables one to execute actions or macros in reponse to
specific `EditBus` messages. The `EditBus` is jEdit's mechanism for
event notification. jEdit "sends" `EditBus` messages when buffers
are opened, closed, properties changed; when views are created or
destroyed; when you switch between edit panes and when other events
occur. As an example, using `ActionHooks`, you could write a macro
to hide all docking areas when you split a view into multiple edit
panes. An example macro for this is provided `below`__. It would be
bound to ``EditPane.CREATED``.

This allows for powerful customization of jEdit. 

Other `Examples`_ include setting custom buffer properties depending
on the buffer's path or automatically displaying `SideKick's`
`Structure Browser` when you switch to a buffer containing an XML
file.

Usage
=====

To use `ActionHooks` you must do 2 things.

1. Enable it.

   By default `ActionHooks` is not enabled. To enable `ActionHooks`
   select `Plugins` > `ActionHooks`. To enable `ActionHooks` by
   default, select `Plugins` > `Plugin Options` > `ActionHooks` >
   `Enable ActionHooks by Default`.

2. Associate actions or macros with events.

   To associate actions or macros with events, go to
   `Plugins` > `Plugin Options` > `ActionHooks`.  You'll see a
   dropdown box with a list of available events 
   (`EditBus` messages).  Use the buttons below to add, remove,
   or change the execution order for actions or macros
   associated with the selected event.


Examples
========

Showing `Structure Browser` for XML buffers
-------------------------------------------

If you associate the following macro with 
``EditPaneUpdate.BUFFER_CHANGED``, when you open
or switch to an xml or xsl buffer, `SideKick's` 
`Structure Browser` will be displayed.  If 
`SideKick's` `Structure Browser` is open and you
switch to a buffer of another type, it will be
hidden.

.. include:: examples/Toggle_Structure_Browser.bsh
    :literal:


Setting Buffer Properties
-------------------------

With the following macro bound to ``EditPaneUpdate.BUFFER_CHANGED``,
custom buffer properties are set when you switch to a buffer whose
filename contains ``project_x`` or ``project_y``. This can be handy
when working on projects with different editing conventions from
your defaults if coding conventions prevent the use of buffer
local properties.

.. include:: examples/Set_Buffer_Properties.bsh
    :literal:


Hiding All Docking Areas
------------------------

If you bind the following macro to ``EditPane.CREATED``, when
you split a view all docking areas will be collapsed to make room
for viewing the edit panes.

.. include:: examples/Hide_Docking_Areas.bsh

Tips
====

* Use `Utilities` > `Troubleshooting` > `Activity Log` (along with
  jEdit's API Documentation) to see when `EditBus` messages are 
  sent.

* Remember that any actions or macros you bind to events
  may be run a lot and/or frequently.  For example, if you 
  bind a macro to ``BufferUpdate.LOADED`` it will be run for 
  each buffer that jEdit re-opens on startup (if enabled).  
  With a large number of buffers open, then may increase 
  startup time.

* If you write macros to bind to `EditBus` messages, test them
  well.  It's easy to make a bit of a mess of things if jEdit
  starts invoking macros which have errors.  Remember you can always
  disable `ActionHooks` via `Plugins` > `ActionHooks`.

* Depending on the event, some operations may not work as expected.
  For example, while a buffer is being saved, the textarea is 
  read-only, so the following macro bound to 
  ``BufferUpdate.SAVING`` wouldn't work::
  
        textArea.selectAll();
        textArea.removeTrailingWhiteSpace();
  
  In this specific example, you could work around the issue
  by modifying the buffer itself, but make sure to read jEdit's
  API docs or code so your actions don't produce unwanted results.


Extending ActionHooks
=====================

By default `ActionHooks` supports the following `EditBus`
messages: 

 * `BufferUpdate`
 * `EditPaneUpdate`
 * `PropertiesChanged`
 * `ViewUpdate`

Plugins can add support for `EditBus` messages they provide by
registering `EBMessageHandler` subclasses with `ActionHooks`.

EBMessageHandler
----------------

An `EBMessageHandler` does the following:

* Tells `ActionHooks` the name of the `EditBus` it handles.
  For example, ``org.gjt.sp.jedit.msg.BufferUpdate``.
* Tells `ActionHooks` the list of "events" associated
  with the `EditBus` message it handles. For example,
  ``BufferUpdate.LOADED``, ``BufferUpdate.CLOSED``, 
  ``BufferUpdate.SAVING``, ``BufferUpdate.SAVED``.
* When an `EditBus` message is sent an `EBMessageHandler`
  tells `ActionHooks` which event it corresponds to.  
  For example, a ``BufferUpdate`` message is sent for
  ``BufferUpdate.LOADED``, ``BufferUpdate.CLOSED``, 
  ``BufferUpdate.SAVING``, ``BufferUpdate.SAVED``.
  The `EBMessageHandler` must specify which "event" the
  specific `EditBus` is for.
* Tells `ActionHooks` which view to use for invoking
  EditActions or Macros for an event.

EBMessageHandler Example
------------------------

Writing an `EBMessageHandler` is actually pretty simple. Here's the
source for `PropertiesChangedHandler`::

    package actionhooks.handler;
    
    import org.gjt.sp.jedit.EBMessage;
    import org.gjt.sp.jedit.View;
    import org.gjt.sp.jedit.msg.PropertiesChanged;
    
    import actionhooks.EBMessageHandler;
    
    public class PropertiesChangedHandler extends EBMessageHandler
    {
    
        static String[] events = {"PropertiesChanged"};
    
        public String getMessageName()
        {
            return "org.gjt.sp.jedit.msg.PropertiesChanged";
        }
    
        public View getView(EBMessage msg)
        {
            return null;
        }
    
        public String[] getEventNames()
        {
            return this.events;
        }
    
        public String getEventName(EBMessage msg)
        {
            return "PropertiesChanged";
        }
    
    }

See the source code for `ActionHooks` for more examples.

Registering an EBMessageHandler
-------------------------------

Plugins register an `EBMessageHandler` using::

    ActionHooksPlugin.registerHandler(<handler>);

and unregister a handler using::

    ActionHooksPlugin.unregisterHandler(<handler>);
