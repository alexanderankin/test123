The Java SideKick plug-in provides a highly customizable tool for navigating through Java source code. Using SideKick, you can see a tree view for the hierarchy of classes, interfaces, and methods for the file in the current buffer. In addition, attributes, extends, implements and method exception information can be displayed.
</p>
<p>JavaSideKick, as of version 2.3.0, requires Java 1.5.  JavaSideKick parses and displays these files:
<ul>
<li>Java source files (.java). All Java 1.5 and earlier syntax is supported, including generics, varargs, autobox and the enhanced "for" loop syntax.</li>
<li>JavaCC source files (.jj, .jjt).  JavaCC files for JavaCC version 4.0 and 3.x are supported.  Earlier versions have not been tested.</li>
<!-- <li>Property files conforming to java.util.Properties.</li> -->
</ul>
</p>
<p> Like all SideKick plugins, JavaSideKick has no dockable view. Instead, it shares its view with other SideKick plugins through the SideKick Dockable. It is suggested you dock this to the left or the right. </p>

<p>
"JBrowse" was the original Java browser plugin for jEdit, but is no longer being maintained.  The "Java SideKick" retains all of the customizations that were provided by JBrowse, plus takes advantage of the features provided by SideKick. This documentation is based on the original provided with JBrowse.
</p>
<p>
A single mouse click on one of the nodes in the tree will highlight the
line in the jEdit buffer where the definition of that item begins.
Options are provided to control both what is displayed and how. Shift-click
on a node will select that node in the buffer, so, for example, shift-clicking
on a method will select the entire method.  By virtue of SideKick, the tree will also follow the cursor in the buffer, so the selected node in the tree will change as you move from method to method in your source code.
</p>

<p>
This version requires:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>JDK 1.5</li>
    <li>jEdit 4.3</li>
</ul>

SideKick displays the hierarchy of elements in a tree
using the options (see below) you have specified. You can choose to use either the standard icon set inherited from JBrowse, or icons like those used in Eclipse. Each element is displayed with one of the following icons:
</p>

<p>
<img src="../sidekick/java/icons/Class.gif" alt="Class icon">
&nbsp;<strong>Class</strong> - all top-level classes, i.e. direct package
 members and nested static classes.
</p>
<img src="../sidekick/java/icons/Interface.gif" alt="Interface icon">
&nbsp;<strong>Interface</strong> - all top-level interfaces, i.e. direct
package members and nested interfaces.
<p>
<img src="../sidekick/java/icons/InnerClass.gif" alt="Member Class icon">
&nbsp;<strong>Member Class</strong> - nested instance classes, i.e.
non-static member classes. </p>
<p>
<img src="../sidekick/java/icons/Extends.gif" alt="Extends icon">
&nbsp;<strong>Extends</strong> - a class that this class extends, or an
interface that this interface extends. </p>
<p>
<img src="../sidekick/java/icons/Implements.gif" alt="Implements icon">
&nbsp;<strong>Implements</strong> - an interface that this class implements. </p>
<p>
<img src="../sidekick/java/icons/Operation.gif" alt="Operation icon">
&nbsp;<strong>Operation</strong> - operations (i.e. methods, functions,
whatever you want to call them). </p>
<p>
<img src="../sidekick/java/icons/Throws.gif" alt="Throws icon">
&nbsp;<strong>Throws</strong> - the type of an exception that this operation
throws. </p>
<p>
<img src="../sidekick/java/icons/Attribute.gif" alt="Attribute icon">
&nbsp;<strong>Fields and Local Variables</strong> - both object and primitive fields
as well as local variables may be
displayed (see filter options below).
</p>
<p>
<img src="../sidekick/java/icons/Error.gif" alt="Error icon">
&nbsp;<strong>Error</strong> - the parser has encountered an error in the
source file.  The specific error will be displayed in the ErrorList plugin.
Fix the error and reparse to redisplay the tree.
</p>

<p>
It is possible to show these icons in the same style as Eclipse.  Go to Plugins - Plugin Options - Java SideKick, then check "Show icons" and "like Eclipse".
</p>

<p>
For javacc files the following icons may be displayed:
</p>
<p>

to be re-built based on the current contents of the active buffer. When Java SideKick is
opened, it automatically does this (unless the file does not have a &quot;.java&quot; extension).
Changing any options will automatically update the tree display. Thus, the only
reason to re-parse is because the file contents have changed, or a different buffer
has been activated or because you want to check a file for errors before saving.

<p>
Note: Java SideKick is a SideKick extension, so some settings are controlled
by the SideKick plugin itself (Plugins-&gt;Plugin Options-&gt;SideKick).  The
options described here are specific to Java SideKick (Plugins-&gt;Plugin Options-&gt;JavaSideKick);
</p>
<p>
Java SideKick is highly configurable, using a set of option values
that control the behavior and appearance of the tree that is displayed
for a parsed Java program file. A set of default option values is stored
in a property file, which is loaded each time a new Java SideKick session is
started. While Java SideKick is running these options may be changed on-the-fly
using the Java SideKick Options Dialog.
</p>
<p>
The tables below describe the effect of each option value. These options
are grouped into two basic categories:
</p>
<hr size="1" >
<h3>Filtering options (<em>What</em> to display):</h3>

<p>
These options specify which types of elements are to be displayed in the tree.
Changing any of these options will cause the entire tree to be reloaded
using the new option setting.
</p>

<table
    summary="Filtering options"
    width="100%"
    border="1">
    <tr>
        <td>Attributes</td>
        <td>If set then Object attributes will be included in the tree.</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>include primitives</td>
        <td>If set then primitive attributes
        will also be included in the tree.</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>Show local variables</td>
        <td>If set, then local variables within method bodies will be displayed. </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>show static initializers</td>
        <td>If set, then static initializer blocks will be included in the tree.
        Since static blocks don't have names, the name in the tree will be
        "static_XX", where XX is the line number for the start of the block. </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>extends/implements</td>
        <td>If set then for each class and interface the classes and interfaces that they
        extend or implement (if any) will be displayed as their immediate child nodes
        in the tree.</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>Method throws type(s)</td>
        <td>If set then the types of all exceptions that an operation is defined to
        throw (if any) will be listed as the immediate child nodes of that operation.</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>Lowest Visibility level to show, Top-Level</td>
        <td>Specifies the minimum visibility level
        that a top-level element (non-nested class or interface) must have to be
        displayed in the tree.</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>

        <td>Specifies the minimum visibility level
        that a member element (attribute or method) must have to be displayed
        in the tree.</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<hr size="2" >

<h3>Display options (<em>How</em> to display):</h3>

<p>
These options specify the format that is to be used to display the elements in the tree.
Changing any of these options will normally update the display without reloading the
tree.
</p>

<h4>General Display Options</h4>

<p>
The following options can be set independently of the current Display Style.
</p>

<table
    summary="Display options"
    width="100%"
    border="1"
>
    <tr>
        <td>Arguments</td>
        <td>If set then the type signature of each
        argument will be displayed for operations.</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>formal names</td>
        <td>If set then the formal names of each argument
        will be displayed for operations.</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>Show Generics type arguments</td>
        <td>If set, then generics type arguments, if any, will be shown.  This
        applies to all elements that may show a generic type. </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>Qualify nested class/interface names</td>
        <td>If set then fully qualified names will be displayed for all nested classes
        and interfaces (as opposed to just the final component of the name).</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>Keywords specified by icons</td>
        <td>If set then the keywords directly associated with the icons for
        <code>class, interface, extends, implements &amp; throws</code>
        will be displayed, otherwise they are suppressed.</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>Implementation detail modifiers</td>
        <td>If set then display all implementation detail modifiers
        (i.e. <code>synchronized, native, strictfp, transient, &amp; volatile</code>),
        else suppress these modifiers.</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>Line Numbers</td>
        <td>If set then the line number at which the
        definition of each element begins will be displayed.</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>Sort by</td>
        <td>Item can be sorted by line, name, or visibility.</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>Show parse errors in ErrorList</td>
        <td>If set then any errors found during parsing of the buffer will be displayed
        in the ErrorList plugin.  For Java files, this can be useful since the parser
        will find most of the errors that will be found by javac without the overhead
        of invoking the compiler.
        </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>Display Style</td>
        <td>Can be set to Java (all custom options
        off), UML (all custom options on) or Custom (allows individual settings
        for all custom options).</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>
Since JavaSickKick is a SideKick extension, mousing over items in the tree
will cause the full details of the item to be displayed in jEdit's status
bar.  This means you can do things like turn off display of line numbers in
the tree, but still see the line number for an item by moving the mouse over
the item then looking in the status bar.  Mousing over the root of the tree
will also show some statistics about the file: class, interface, method,
and field count will be displayed in the status bar.
</p>


<h4>Custom Display Options</h4>

<p>
The following options are controlled by the current Display Style.
they can be individually set if the current Display Style is set to
&#39;Custom&#39;.

        <td>Use Visibility Symbols</td>
        <td>If set then 'public', 'protected', 'package' and 'private'
        visibility is labeled by a '+', '#', ' ' or '-', respectively.</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>Abstract in italics</td>
        <td>If set then interfaces and abstract classes
        and methods are identified by appearing in italics (as opposed to specifying
        the modifier).</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>Static as underlined</td>
        <td>If set static methods and attributes are
        identified by being underlined, (as opposed to presence of the 'static'
        modifier).</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>Type identifier as a suffix&nbsp;</td>
        <td>If set then the type identifiers (for method return types, arguments
        and attributes) will appear after the item whose type is being specified
        (preceded by a ' : ').</td>

There are no longer any actions.  There was some thought at one time to provide
certain code checking actions, however, the PMD plugin does code checking much better
than this plugin.  If you write Java code, you really should install the PMD
plugin too.

<h4>Code Completion</h4>

<p>
JavaSideKick offers several different uses for code completion. The line at the
end of each example represents the cursor position when completion is invoked
(Plugins -&gt; SideKick -&gt; Show Completion Popup).
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Local variables and methods:
	<pre>
	String word = getWordAtCursor();
	wo
	</pre>
	</li>

	<li>Public methods and fields of a variable:
	<pre>
	String word = getWordAtCursor();
	word.
	</pre>
	or, to filter results by name:
	<pre>
	String word = getWordAtCursor();
	word.rep
	</pre>
	</li>

	<li>Methods, fields, and inner classes of the current buffer:
	<pre>
	this.
	</pre>
	or, values of the buffer's superclass (includes protected values,
	which are displayed in the popup as italics):
	<pre>
	super.
	</pre>
	</li>

	<li>Constructors:
	<pre>
	String word = new String(
	</pre>
	</li>

	<li>Packages. By default, this will replace the class name with its fully-qualified
	name, but it is possible to turn on an option which will instead insert an import
	statement for you at the top of the buffer:
	<pre>
	Scanner
	</pre>
	</li>

	<li>Casts:
	<pre>
	Object ob = getStringAsObject();
	((String) ob).
	</pre>
	</li>
</ul>

    </tr>
</table>


<h4>Integration with ProjectViewer</h4>

If ProjectViewer is available, JavaSideKick can use some settings from ProjectViewer
to provide class, source, and build path settings for code completion.

<p>
To set up JavaSideKick to work with ProjectViewer:
<ol>
   <li>Open a project in ProjectViewer.</li>
   <li>Open the properties for the project</li>
   <li>In the left panel of the project properties, choose 'Classpath settings'.</li>
   <li>In the "Classpath" section, add directories, jars, and/or .classpath files as
   necessary for your project.</li>
   <li>Fill in the build output path for your project.</li>
</ol>
A new feature (as of version 2.6) is the ability to add .classpath files.  These files
are common in projects created with Eclipse and define a set of library and source files
for a project.  JavaSideKick will read these files and add the library files to the
"Classpath" settings.
<p>
The "Source path" settings are not used for code completion.  The code completion algorithm
depends on compiled classes to work. Like the "Classpath" section, you can also select a
.classpath file (like those generated by Eclipse and IDEA), and source paths defined in
the .classpath file will be added to the "Source path" settings.
<p>
These paths can also be used by other plugins wanting to know per-project class and source path settings.
Once the paths are set as above, the settings are available with these property names:
<p>
<ul>
<li>sidekick.java.pv.<i>projectName</i>.useJavaClasspath -- this is a boolean property
and reflects the state of the "Include system classpath?" checkbox.  You can get this
property by calling jEdit.getBooleanProperty(sidekick.java.pv.<i>projectName</i>.useJavaClasspath).</li>
<li>sidekick.java.pv.<i>projectName</i>.optionalClasspath -- this is a string property
that contains all paths set in the "Classpath" box separated by the platform path separator
as returned by System.getProperty("path.separator").  You can get this property by calling
jEdit.getProperty(sidekick.java.pv.<i>projectName</i>.optionalClasspath).</li>
<li>sidekick.java.pv.<i>projectName</i>.optionalSourcepath -- this is a string property
that contains all paths set in the "Source path" box separated by the platform path
separator as returned by System.getProperty("path.separator").  You can get this
property by calling jEdit.getProperty(sidekick.java.pv.<i>projectName</i>.optionalSourcepath).</li>
</ul>
<p>
Users of the obsolete JavaCore plugin should take note that these are the same property names that JavaCore set.

<p>
There are a few utility methods in sidekick.java.PVHelper that may be useful:
<p>
<ul>
<li><code>public static boolean isProjectViewerAvailable()</code> will return
true if ProjectViewer is currently available.</li>
<li><code>public static String getProjectNameForFile( String filename )</code>
will return the name of a project for a given filename.</li>
<li><code>public static Path getClassPathForProject(String projectName)</code>
will return a sidekick.java.util.Path from the current ProjectViewer settings, including the system classpath if checked.  This may be more convenient than fetching the path string and parsing it yourself.</li>
<li><code>public static Path getSourcePathForProject(String projectName)</code>
will return a sidekick.java.util.Path from the current ProjectViewer settings.  This may be more convenient than fetching the path string and parsing it yourself.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Building the Parser with javacc</h4>

The source code for the JavaSideKick plugin is ready to build with javac and
jar.  On occasion, it may be necessary to make changes to the parser.  The
parser is actually created by javacc (home page https://javacc.dev.java.net/).
Javacc is a parser generator, it reads a 'grammar specification' file, and
from that file creates a number of java files that can recognize matches to
that grammar.
<p>
The <code>parser</code> directory contains a number of files.  Only one should be
edited, and a second deserves special mention. The remaining files should
never be dealt with by hand. </p>
<p>
This file can be edited.  It contains all the parsing code and builds
the TigerNodes for the tree: </p>
<ul>
<li>Tiger.jj</li>
</ul>
This file is used by javacc to actually create the parser.
<p>
This file should not be edited (unless you know exactly what you're doing). </p>
<ul>
<li>Token.java</li>
</ul>
This file is used by Tiger.jj to parsing Java source code into tokens.
It has been hand-modified specifically for Tiger.jj.
<p>
The remaining files are generated by javacc from Tiger.jj.  Do not edit
these by hand.  The build file will delete these files and regenerate
them when the <code>javacc</code> target is executed. </p>
<p>
Once the Tiger.jj file has been processed by javacc, the complete plugin
can be built by javac. So the build sequence is: </p>
<ul>
<li>Tiger.jj -&gt; javacc -&gt; TigerParser.java (and generated files) -&gt; javac -&gt; .class files -&gt; jar -&gt; JavaSideKick plugin</li>
</ul>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
