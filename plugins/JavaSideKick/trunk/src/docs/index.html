<p>
"JBrowse" was the original Java browser plugin for jEdit, but is no longer being
maintained.  The "Java SideKick" 
retains all of the customizations that were provided by JBrowse, plus takes
advantage of the features provided by SideKick.  This documentation is based
on the original provided with JBrowse.
</p>
<p>
The &quot;Java SideKick&quot; plug-in provides a highly customizable tool for
navigating through Java source code.
It displays a navigation window which uses a tree view to display the
hierarchy of classes, interfaces, and methods for the file in the
current buffer.
In addition, attributes, extends, implements and method exception
information can be displayed.
A single mouse click on one of the nodes in the tree will highlight the
line in the jEdit buffer where the definition of that item begins.
Options are provided to control both what is displayed and how. Shift-click
on a node will select that node in the buffer, so, for example, shift-clicking
on a method will select the entire method.  By virtue of SideKick, the tree
will also follow the cursor in the buffer, so the selected node in the tree
will change as you move from method to method in your source code.
</p>

<p>
This version requires:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>JDK 1.4</li>
    <li>jEdit 4.2</li>
</ul>
Note that while this plugin only requires Java 1.4, all Java 1.5 syntax is
supported, including generics, varargs, autobox and the enhanced "for" loop 
syntax.

<p>
Java SideKick displays the hierarchy of elements in a tree
using the options (see below) you have specified. Each element is displayed with one of
the following icons:
</p>

<p>
<img src="../sidekick/java/icons/Class.gif" alt="Class icon"
>&nbsp;<strong>Class</strong> - all top-level classes, i.e. direct package
 members and nested static classes.
<br><br>
<img src="../sidekick/java/icons/Interface.gif" alt="Interface icon"
>&nbsp;<strong>Interface</strong> - all top-level interfaces, i.e. direct
package members and nested interfaces.
<br><br>
<img src="../sidekick/java/icons/InnerClass.gif" alt="Member Class icon"
>&nbsp;<strong>Member Class</strong> - nested instance classes, i.e.
non-static member classes.
<br><br>
<img src="../sidekick/java/icons/Extends.gif" alt="Extends icon"
>&nbsp;<strong>Extends</strong> - a class that this class extends, or an
interface that this interface extends.
<br><br>
<img src="../sidekick/java/icons/Implements.gif" alt="Implements icon"
>&nbsp;<strong>Implements</strong> - an interface that this class implements.
<br><br>
<img src="../sidekick/java/icons/Operation.gif" alt="Operation icon"
>&nbsp;<strong>Operation</strong> - operations (i.e. methods, functions,
whatever you want to call them).
<br><br>
<img src="../sidekick/java/icons/Throws.gif" alt="Throws icon"
>&nbsp;<strong>Throws</strong> - the type of an exception that this operation
throws.
<br><br>
<img src="../sidekick/java/icons/Attribute.gif" alt="Attribute icon"
>&nbsp;<strong>Fields</strong> - both object and primitive fields may be
displayed (see filter options below).

<p>
<img src="jeditresource:/org/gjt/sp/jedit/icons/Parse.png" alt="Parse button icon">
<strong>Parse button</strong> - Clicking this button will cause the tree hierarchy
to be re-built based on the current contents of the active buffer. When Java SideKick is
opened, it automatically does this (unless the file does not have a &quot;.java&quot; extension).
Changing any options will automatically update the tree display. Thus, the only
reason to re-parse is because the file contents have changed, or a different buffer
has been activated or because you are curious what Java SideKick will do if you attempt
to parse a binary file.

<p>
Note: Java SideKick is a SideKick extension, so some settings are controlled
by the SideKick plugin itself (Plugins-&gt;Plugin Options-&gt;SideKick).  The
options described here are specific to Java SideKick (Plugins-&gt;Plugin Options-&gt;JavaSideKick);
</p>
<p>
Java SideKick is highly configurable, using a set of option values
that control the behavior and appearance of the tree that is displayed
for a parsed Java program file. A set of default option values is stored
in a property file, which is loaded each time a new Java SideKick session is
started. While Java SideKick is running these options may be changed on-the-fly
using the Java SideKick Options Dialog.
<br><br>
The tables below describe the effect of each option value. These options
are grouped into two basic categories:
</p>

<h3>Filtering options (<em>What</em> to display):</h3>

<p>
These options specify which types of elements are to be displayed in the tree.
Changing any of these options will cause the entire tree to be reloaded
using the new option setting.
</p>

<table
    summary="Filtering options"
    width="100%"
    border="1"
>
    <tr>
        <td>Attributes</td>
        <td>If set then Object attributes will be included in the tree.</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>include primitives</td>
        <td>If set then primitive attributes
        will also be included in the tree.</td>
    </tr>
    
    <tr>
        <td>show static initializers</td>
        <td>If set, then static initializer blocks will be included in the tree.
        Since static blocks don't have names, the name in the tree will be 
        "static_XX", where XX is the line number for the start of the block.
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>extends/implements</td>
        <td>If set then for each class and interface the classes and interfaces that they
        extend or implement (if any) will be displayed as their immediate child nodes
        in the tree.</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>Method throws type(s)</td>
        <td>If set then the types of all exceptions that an operation is defined to
        throw (if any) will be listed as the immediate child nodes of that operation.</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>Lowest Visibility level to show, Top-Level</td>
        <td>Specifies the minimum visibility level
        that a top-level element (non-nested class or interface) must have to be
        displayed in the tree.</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>Lowest Visibility level to show, Member</td>
        <td>Specifies the minimum visibility level
        that a member element (attribute or method) must have to be displayed
        in the tree.</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<h3>Display options (<em>How</em> to display):</h3>

<p>
These options specify the format that is to be used to display the elements in the tree.
Changing any of these options will normally update the display without reloading the
tree.
</p>

<h4>General Display Options</h4>

<p>
The following options can be set independently of the current Display Style.
</p>

<table
    summary="Display options"
    width="100%"
    border="1"
>
    <tr>
        <td>Arguments</td>
        <td>If set then the type signature of each
        argument will be displayed for operations.</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>formal names</td>
        <td>If set then the formal names of each argument
        will be displayed for operations.</td>
    </tr>
    
    <tr>
        <td>Show Generics type arguments</td>
        <td>If set, then generics type arguments, if any, will be shown.  This
        applies to all elements that may show a generic type.
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>Qualify nested class/interface names</td>
        <td>If set then fully qualified names will be displayed for all nested classes
        and interfaces (as opposed to just the final component of the name).</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>Keywords specified by icons</td>
        <td>If set then the keywords directly associated with the icons for
        <code>class, interface, extends, implements &amp; throws</code>
        will be displayed, otherwise they are suppressed.</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>Implementation detail modifiers</td>
        <td>If set then display all implementation detail modifiers
        (i.e. <code>synchronized, native, strictfp, transient, &amp; volatile</code>),
        else suppress these modifiers.</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>Line Numbers</td>
        <td>If set then the line number at which the
        definition of each element begins will be displayed.</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>Sort by</td>
        <td>Item can be sorted by line, name, or visibility.</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>Display Style</td>
        <td>Can be set to Java (all custom options
        off), UML (all custom options on) or Custom (allows individual settings
        for all custom options).</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<h4>Custom Display Options</h4>

<p>
The following options are controlled by the current Display Style.
they can be individually set if the current Display Style is set to
&#39;Custom&#39;.

    <tr>
        <td>Use Visibility Symbols</td>
        <td>If set then 'public', 'protected', 'package' and 'private'
        visibility is labeled by a '+', '#', ' ' or '-', respectively.</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>Abstract in italics</td>
        <td>If set then interfaces and abstract classes
        and methods are identified by appearing in italics (as opposed to specifying
        the modifier).</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>Static as underlined</td>
        <td>If set static methods and attributes are
        identified by being underlined, (as opposed to presence of the 'static'
        modifier).</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>Type identifier as a suffix&nbsp;</td>
        <td>If set then the type identifiers (for method return types, arguments
        and attributes) will appear after the item whose type is being specified
        (preceded by a ' : ').</td>
    </tr>
