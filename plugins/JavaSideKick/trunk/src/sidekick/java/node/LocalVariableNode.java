/**
 * An extension of TigerNode to represent a local variable, that is, a field
 * within a block within a class or class member. Local variables differ from
 * fields in that they don't have modifiers (e.g. no 'public' or 'private').
 * Note: in UML, this is known as an "attribute".  I avoid that usage in
 * TigerBrowser and use "field" as this is the term used throughout the
 * JVM Specification.
