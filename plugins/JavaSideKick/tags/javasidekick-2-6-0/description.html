The JavaSideKick plug-in provides a highly customizable tool for navigating
through Java source code. Using Sidekick, you can see a tree view for the
hierarchy of classes, interfaces, and methods for the file in the current
buffer. In addition, attributes, extends, implements and method exception
information can be displayed.

In addition to java files, JavaSideKick also handles javacc files (.jj and .jjt)
and java property files.
