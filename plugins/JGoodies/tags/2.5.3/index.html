        <h2>JGoodies Look and Feel Plugin</h2>
        <b>Author: Dale Anson</b><br/>
        <b>Version: 2.5.3, Dec 2020</b>
      </div>
        <p>This plugin provides four JGoodies Look and Feels to jEdit:
        <ul>
         <li>JGoodies Plastic</li>
         <li>JGoodies Plastic3D</li>
         <li>JGoodies PlasticXP</li>
         <li>JGoodies Windows (only if the current operating system is a version of Windows)</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
        These look and feels were developed to help make java applications blend in on Windows. 
        They look pretty good on other operating systems also.

        <h3 id="about" style="background:#7FB2FF">About</h3>
        <p>JGoodies was developed by JGoodies Software. The version included in this plugin is 
        the last free version, later versions require a fee.</p>
        <p>Here's a description that I copied from the JGoodies website:</p>
        <p>
Precise Windows Emulation<br>

Our Windows look&amp;feel focuses on a precise emulation on Windows XP, Vista, 7, 8, 8.1, 
and now Windows 10 in the following areas: menus, icons, colors, borders, fonts, font sizes, 
insets, and widget dimensions. It honors the screen resolution (low vs. high dpi) to adjust 
sizes, insets, and widget dimensions.
