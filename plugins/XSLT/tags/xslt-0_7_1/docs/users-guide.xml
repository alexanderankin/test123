    <title>Overview</title>
    <para>
      The XSLT plugin provides features for transforming XML documents using
      XSLT stylesheets, saving transformation configuration settings and
      viewing the results of evaluating XPath expressions.
    </para>
    <para>NOTE: The XML indent functionality that formerly was included in
    the XSLT plugin has been moved into the XML plugin.</para>

    <title>XSLT Processor Tool</title>
    <para>
      The XSLT Processor allows you to transform a source XML document using
      a series of XSL stylesheets. <ulink url="http://www.w3.org/Style/XSL/">XSL
      and XSLT</ulink> are W3C-specified standards for XML stylesheets and
      stylesheet transformations, respectively.
    </para>
    <para>
      To use the XSLT Processor:
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>To dock the tool, from the Plugins menu select
          "XSLT->XSLT Processor". Note that you may select where a Plugin is
          docked from "Utilies->Global Options->jEdit->Docking".</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Select a source XML file, by using the "Select XML source"
          button and subsequent dialog. The button is located
          next to the source text field at the top of the tool.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Modify the list of stylesheets using the buttons with the "Add
          stylesheet", "Remove stylesheet", "Move up" and "Move down" buttons
          (the buttons with the plus, minus, up and down icons).</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>If the first stylesheet in the list has parameters that
          you wish to populate, you can add parameters
          via the "Add stylesheet parameter" button.
          For example if the XSLT param element is
          &lt;xsl:param name="uri"/&gt;, you can add
          a parameter with name "uri" to the parameter table.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Name a file for the result to be saved to by pressing the "Name
          result file" button next to the result text field at the bottom of the
          tool. In the dialog window select a directory, enter a file name and
          then press the "Open" button (a bit confusing but it will work).</para>
          
          <para>The result will be written to a new untitled buffer if you click 
          the <guibutton>New Untitled Buffer</guibutton> radio button.
          Note that it will be written in memory only,
          so don't use this option with too big a document.
          Also note that if any <code>&lt;xsl:result-document&gt;</code> instruction is used, 
          it won't be written in memory but to a file relative to the new Untitled buffer.
          </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Files can be opened for editing from the XSLT Processor window,
          using enter key, or right click menu select on the
          file name.</para>
          <para>If you don't want to open the result of the transformation
          (e.g. because the result is too big), uncheck the <guilabel>Open result</guilabel>
          check-box.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Run the transformation using the "Transform XML" button.
          This will perform the selected XSL transformations on the source XML
          and place the result in a new buffer. If more than one stylesheet
          is selected then the result from a prior stylesheet
          in the list becomes the input to the next stylesheet.
          If you entered a result file name, then the new buffer will be saved
          to a file with that name.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>You can invoke the "Transform XML" action via a
          keyboard shortcut or toolbar icon; this can be configured from
          "Utilities->Global Options->jEdit->Shortcuts" or
          "Utilities->Global Options->jEdit->Tool Bar" respectively.
          The XSLT Processor will have to be docked in order for this binding
          to work.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>You can save the current settings by
          clicking on the "Save settings" button, which is next to the
          "Transform XML button". In the File System Browser dialog specify a name
          for the settings file, then click "Save".
          The saved settings are formatted as an
          <ulink url="http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/">Ant</ulink>
          build file. This build file can be run with Ant
          independently of the plugin to perform the same transformation.
          If you want to make manual changes to this file and still be able
          to load the original settings, keep a copy of the original file.
          To run Ant files from within jEdit, download the
          "Ant Farm" plugin.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Saved settings can be loaded via the "Load saved settings"
          button, which is next to the "Save settings" button.
          In the File System Browser dialog select the settings
          file that you wish to load, then click "Open". The settings
          from file will be loaded into the GUI. Caution, if you have
          manually changed the settings file, it may no longer be
          loadable by the XSLT plugin.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
    </para>
    <section id="error-list"><title>Error Reporting</title>
    
    <para>Errors are reported via the <emphasis>ErrorList</emphasis> plugin
    and/or a popup message :</para>
    <itemizedlist>
    <listitem><para>
    any error due to a broken stylesheet will result in an error in the ErrorList
    dockable and a popup dialog telling you about the error;</para></listitem>
    <listitem><para>
    any error while reading the source document will result in an error in the ErrorList
    dockable and a popup dialog telling you about the error;</para></listitem>
    <listitem><para>
    any warning reported by the XSLT processor will only be reported as a warning 
    in the ErrorList dockable.
    Be warned that some pretty strong errors (like an <code>xsl:element</code>
    with an invalid name, thus not created) are not reported;
    </para></listitem>
    <listitem><para>
    any error (<code>error</code> or <code>fatalError</code>) 
    reported by the XSLT processor will be reported in the ErrorList dockable
    and in a popup dialog.
    </para></listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>Processing will be immediately terminated in case of error (even non-fatal),
    but will continue in case of warnings.</para>
    </section>
    
    <section id="todo-xslt"><title>To Do...</title>
    <para>
      The following improvements should eventually be made to XSLT Processor.
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Users should be able to edit the XSLT Processor settings (e.g.
          indent amount) via an XSLT plugin section in global options.
          Note: The indent amount for the result XML is set to 2 spaces per indent
          level. Currently this setting can only be changed in the XSLT.props file,
          which is contained in the XSLT.jar file.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
    </para>
    </section>
    <section id="compile-stylesheet">
    <title>Compiling a stylesheet</title>
    
    <para>I find it useful to have the stylesheet compiled even if don't run the
    stylesheet in jEdit. This allows for basic tests to be performed 
    on the stylesheet and catches many stupid errors that I would only have seen
    when running it. I found the Saxon 9.2 XSLT processor to report the most errors;
    this may be related to the precisions in the XSLT 2.0 specification, but I heard that Michael Kay
    put a good deal of effort in outputting explicit error messages.
    </para>
    
    <para>Anyway, you can invoke the action <code>xslt.compile</code> to compile
    the stylesheet in current buffer.You can also check an option in the XSLT
    option pane (see <xref linkend="options"/>) to always compile XSLT stylesheets
    on save.</para>
    </section>

    <section id="three-way-mode"><title>Three-way mode</title>
    
    <para>The three-way mode is intended to provide a comfortable workbench for
    experimenting with XSLT.</para>
    
    <para>To activate this mode, you can use the menu
    <guimenu>Plugins</guimenu> > <guisubmenu>XSLT</guisubmenu> > <guimenuitem>3-Way mode</guimenuitem>,
    or the action <code>xslt.three-way-mode</code>.
    This will split the current view in three, open three buffers and insert a template
    stylesheet in the second one (version 1.0 or 2.0, depending upon the XSLT processor you selected
    in the <guimenuitem>Plugin Options</guimenuitem>). It will also open the XSLT processor dockable,
    (which I usually dock at left) and enable its 3-way mode.
    </para>
    
    <para>In the 3-way mode the input,stylesheets and result settings
    of the XSLT Processor dockable are disabled.
    You may only add parameters and run the transformation.
    To use this mode of the XSLT Processor, you need a view split into three with :
    <itemizedlist>
    <listitem><para>a source XML document, in <guilabel>xml</guilabel> mode;</para></listitem>
    <listitem><para>a stylesheet, in <guilabel>xsl</guilabel> mode;</para></listitem>
    <listitem><para>a result buffer, in any mode.</para></listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    </para>
    <para>As long as an xml buffer and an xslt buffer can be found, the buffers can be in any order.
    However, if the edit modes don't match exactly, the buffers will used in the order listed above,
    regardless of their mode.
    If 2 buffers are in xml mode, the first one will be assumed to be the source.
    If 2 buffers are in xsl mode, the canonical ordering will be used.</para>
    
    <para>The result of the transformation will be inserted in the result buffer
    if the result buffer is not read-only, or in a new untitled buffer otherwise.
    Any previous content of the result buffer will be available via the <guilabel>Undo</guilabel>
    action.</para>
    
    <note><para>This feature is still experimental; feedback on its usability would
    be appreciated.</para></note>

           <para>Transformation result is written directly to file. The file is opened
           in a new buffer, or the file is reloaded if already open in a buffer. If
           the file is already open then the result buffer will not gain focus after transformation is
           completed, this is helpful for when using split panes while editing. Perhaps
           whether the result buffer gets the focus should be made configurable in
           a future release.</para>
