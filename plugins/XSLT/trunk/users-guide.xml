    <title>Overview</title>
    <para>
      The XSLT plugin contains facilities to perform XSL Transformations
      and evaluate XPath expressions.
    </para>
  </chapter>

  <chapter id="XSLTProcessor">
    <title>XSLT Processor</title>
    <para>
      The XSLT Processor allows you to transform a source XML document using
      a series of XSL stylesheets. <ulink url="http://www.w3.org/Style/XSL/">XSL
      and XSLT</ulink> are W3C-specified standards for XML stylesheets and
      stylesheet transformations, respectively.
    </para>
    <para>
      To use the XSLT Processor, select "XSLT Processor" from the Plugins menu.
      This will dock the XSLT Processor.  (Note that you may select where a 
      Plugin is docked from jEdit's Global Options menu.)
    </para>
    <para>
      Once the XLST Processor has been docked, you may select your source 
      by pressing the button labeled "Select".  Next, you may create
      the list of stylesheets which should be used to transform the source by
      using the "Add" button (and subsequent dialog).  When you're ready, 
      press the "Transform" button.  This will perform the appropriate XSL
      Transformations on the Source document and place the results in a new buffer.
      (Transformation will start with the stylesheet at the top of the list 
      and proceed to the bottom.)    
    </para>
    <para>
      For convenience, an action named "Transform" has been bound to the
      "Transform" button.  This allows you to invoke a transformation via
      a keyboard shortcut or toolbar icon by configuring your Global Options.
      (The XSLT Processor will have to be docked in order for this binding
      to work.)
    </para>
    <para>
      The following improvements should eventually be made to XPath Tool.
      (Any volunteers?)
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          DTD handling is still somewhat weak.  URL-specified DTDs
          are reloaded on each evaluation, and SYSTEM DTDs are
          assumed to be in the same directory as the XML file
          which references them.  Ultimately, this should be enhanced
          to behave more intelligently, as in the XML plugin.
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
    </para>
  </chapter>

  <chapter id="XPathTool">
    <title>XPath Tool</title>
    <para>
      The XPath Tool allows you to evalute XPath expressions on an open
      XML buffer.  <ulink url="http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath">XPath</ulink>
      is a W3C-specified syntax for addressing portions of an XML document.
    </para>
    <para>
      To use the XPath Tool, first open a file containing well-formed
      XML.  Then, from the Plugins menu, select "XPath Tool".  This will dock
      the XPath Tool.
    </para>
    <para>
      Once the XPath Tool has been docked, you may enter your XPath
      expression into the upper text area (labeled "XPath Expression").
      When you press the "Evaluate" button, the expression will be
      evaluated against the current buffer and the results will be
      displayed in the lower text area (labeled "Results").  Note
      that the expression will always be evaluated as if the
      document root is the "context node".
    </para>
    <para>
      For convenience, an action named "Evaluate" has been bound to the
      "Evaluate" button.  This allows you to evaluate an expression via
      a keyboard shortcut or toolbar icon by configuring your Global Options.
      (The XPath Tool will have to be docked in order for this binding
      to work.)
    </para>
    <para>
      The following improvements should eventually be made to XPath Tool.

          DTD handling as per XSLT Processor.
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          When the result of an evaluation is a Node set, it would be nice
          to have a "Hyper Search" type of result.  In other words, each
          node in the list could be clicked to highlight the relevant portion
          of the XML doc in the current buffer.
