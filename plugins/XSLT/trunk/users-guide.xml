    <title>Overview</title>
    <para>
      The XSLT plugin contains facilities to perform XSL Transformations, 
      and evaluate XPath expressions. It also includes an evocable
      indent XML action.
    </para>
  </chapter>

  <chapter id="XSLTProcessor">
    <title>XSLT Processor</title>
    <para>
      The XSLT Processor allows you to transform a source XML document using
      a series of XSL stylesheets. <ulink url="http://www.w3.org/Style/XSL/">XSL
      and XSLT</ulink> are W3C-specified standards for XML stylesheets and
      stylesheet transformations, respectively.
    </para>
    <para>
      To use the XSLT Processor, select "XSLT Processor" from the Plugins menu.
      This will dock the XSLT Processor.  (Note that you may select where a 
      Plugin is docked from jEdit's Global Options menu.)
    </para>
    <para>
      Once the XLST Processor has been docked, you may select your source 
      by pressing the button labeled "Select".  Next, you may create
      the list of stylesheets which should be used to transform the source by
      using the "Add" button (and subsequent dialog). Optionally you may name a
      file for the result to be saved to by pressing the "Name" button; in the 
      dialog window select a directory, enter a file name and then press the
      "Open" button (a bit confusing but it will work).
    </para>
    <para>
      When you're ready, press the "Transform" button. This will perform the 
      appropriate XSL Transformations on the Source document and place the 
      result in a new buffer. (Transformation will start with the stylesheet at
      the top of the list and proceed to the bottom.) If you entered a result 
      file name, then the new buffer will be saved to a file under this name.
    </para>
    <para>
      If you want the result of the XSL Transformation to be indented then in
      your stylesheet add an xslt:output element with an attribute indent set to 
      "yes". In the case of a transformation involving several stylesheets, the
      xslt:output element only needs to be defined in the final stylesheet. The
      indent amount is set to 2 spaces per indent level. Currently
      this setting can only be changed in the XSLT.props file, which is 
      contained in the XSLT.jar file.
    </para>
    <para>
      For convenience, an action named "Transform" has been bound to the
      "Transform" button.  This allows you to invoke a transformation via
      a keyboard shortcut or toolbar icon by configuring your Global Options.
      (The XSLT Processor will have to be docked in order for this binding
      to work.)
    </para>
    <para>
      The following improvements should eventually be made to XSLT Processor.
      (Any volunteers?)
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          The ability to save the current list of stylesheets under a user
          defined name. Then the named list of stylesheets could be retrieved 
          when needed for later use.
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          DTD handling is still somewhat weak.  URL-specified DTDs
          are reloaded on each evaluation, and SYSTEM DTDs are
          assumed to be in the same directory as the XML file
          which references them.  Ultimately, this should be enhanced
          to behave more intelligently, as in the XML plugin.
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          Users should be able to edit the XSLT Processor settings (indent
          amount) via an XSLT plugin section in global options.
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          Once an output file has been named for the result via the GUI,
          the auto-saving of the result buffer can't be turned off. Though
          maybe this is not a problem.
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
    </para>
  </chapter>

  <chapter id="Indent XML Buffer">
    <title>Indent XML Buffer Action</title>
    <para>
      An action named "Indent XML Buffer" is provided that allows you to indent
      the contents of the current buffer. This action only works for buffers 
      containing valid XML. You can invoke the indent action via
      a keyboard shortcut or toolbar icon by configuring your Global Options.
    </para>
    <para>
      Currently the indent amount is set to 2 spaces per level. Also strip-space
      (remove whitespace text nodes) is turned on, and normalize-space (remove 
      leading, trailing and consecutive whitespace from text nodes) is turned 
      off. Currently these settings can only be changed in the XSLT.props file, 
      which is contained in the XSLT.jar file.
    </para>
    <para>
      The following improvements should eventually be made to Indent Action.
      (Any volunteers?)
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          Users should be able to edit the Indent XML Buffer settings (indent
          amount, strip-space and normalize-space) via an XSLT plugin section in
          in global options.
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
    </para>
  </chapter>

  <chapter id="XPathTool">
    <title>XPath Tool</title>
    <para>
      The XPath Tool allows you to evaluate XPath expressions on an open
      XML buffer.  <ulink url="http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath">XPath</ulink>
      is a W3C-specified syntax for addressing portions of an XML document.
    </para>
    <para>
      To use the XPath Tool, first open a file containing well-formed
      XML.  Then, from the Plugins menu, select "XPath Tool".  This will dock
      the XPath Tool.
    </para>
    <para>
      Once the XPath Tool has been docked, you may enter your XPath
      expression into the upper text area (labeled "XPath Expression").
      When you press the "Evaluate" button, the expression will be
      evaluated against the current buffer and the results will be
      displayed in the lower text area (labeled "Results").  Note
      that the expression will always be evaluated as if the
      document root is the "context node".
    </para>
    <para>
      For convenience, an action named "Evaluate" has been bound to the
      "Evaluate" button.  This allows you to evaluate an expression via
      a keyboard shortcut or toolbar icon by configuring your Global Options.
      (The XPath Tool will have to be docked in order for this binding
      to work.)
    </para>
    <para>
      The following improvements should eventually be made to XPath Tool.
      (Any volunteers?)
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          DTD handling as per XSLT Processor.
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          When the result of an evaluation is a Node set, it would be nice
          to have a "Hyper Search" type of result.  In other words, each
          node in the list could be clicked to highlight the relevant portion
          of the XML doc in the current buffer.
