Overview
========

`First Mate` implements some editing features from 
`TextMate <http://macromates.com/>`_ (http://macromates.com/).

Its primary feature is `Auto-Paired Characters`. When 
enabled, when you type one of the following characters:

* ``"``
* ``'``
* ``(``
* ``[``
* ``{``

the corresponding closing character is inserted 
after the caret.

* ``" => "|"``
* ``' => '|'``
* ``( => (|)``
* ``[ => [|]``
* ``{ => {|}``

Configuration
=============

Options
-------

``Enable Auto-Paired characters on startup``
	Controls whether `Auto-Paired Characters` is enabled
	when jEdit is started.

``Don't auto-pair apostrophe following letter``
	When enabled, apostrophes aren't auto-paired when an
	apostrophe follows a letter.

``Remove auto-pair character on backspace``
	When enabled, if backspace if the first key you press
	after triggering an auto-pairing, both characters are
	removed.

``Auto-pair characters around selections``
	When enabled, if text is selected, typing an auto-paired
	character will wrap the selection instead of overwriting
	it.  For example::
		
		``[selection] => "[selection]"``

Auto-Paired Characters by Mode
------------------------------

You may control which of the supported characters are 
auto-paired on a mode by mode basis, using properties.
Property names follow this format::

	mode.<MODE>.pair.<CHAR>=boolean

For example, apostrophe is disabled in vbscript by default::

	mode.vbscript.pair.apostrophe=false

The character names to use when setting properties are:

* apostrophe (``'``)
* brace (``{``)
* bracket (``[``)
* parenthesis (``(``)
* quote (``"``)

At present, there is no option pane for controlling
character-pairing by mode.  The properties must by
set by hand.

Future Plans
============

* Smarter Auto-Paired characters (based on syntax highlighting, respecting 
  escape characters, etc...)
