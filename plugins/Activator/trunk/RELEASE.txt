Activator 1.0.5
   Clicking "reload" on ProjectViewer deactivates
   Console + all of its dependent plugins.
   
   When those plugins get deactivated, they 
   were disappearing from the Reloader panel.
   Now they stay on the panel.

   TODO: fix Reload to generate a set of all plugins that were active before the reload,
   and attempt to restart them again.

    
Activator 1.0.4
   Fixed IndexOutOfBounds exception encountered when jpydbg was installed. [workaround]

Activator 1.0.3
   2 UI fixes.

1. The Activator and Reloader are combined
   on a single dockable JTabbedPane.

2. The scrollbar on the reloader is a lot more responsive now. 


Activator 1.0.2
   Updated for CommonControls

Activator 1.0.1
   UI fix that re-selects the last selected plugin
   so you can toggle between activate and deactivate in the Activator. (Alan Ezust)
