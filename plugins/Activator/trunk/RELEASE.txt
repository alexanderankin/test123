Activator 1.0.3
   More UI fixes:
   Now the Activator and Reloader are combined
   on a single dockable JTabbedPane.

   The scrollbar on the reloader is a lot more responsive now. 


Activator 1.0.2
   Updated for CommonControls

Activator 1.0.1
   UI fix that re-selects the last selected plugin
   so you can toggle between activate and deactivate in the Activator. (Alan Ezust)
