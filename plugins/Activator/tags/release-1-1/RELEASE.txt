Activator 1.1 (ezust)
   If you reload a plugin that has dependent plugins,
   before it just deactivated the dependent plugins.
   Now it reloads them too. 
   
   Plugins with circular dependences also get unloaded properly.
    
Activator 1.0.4
   Fixed IndexOutOfBounds exception encountered when jpydbg was installed. [workaround]

Activator 1.0.3
   2 UI fixes. (ezust)

   1. The Activator and Reloader are combined
   on a single dockable JTabbedPane. 

   2. The scrollbar on the reloader is a lot more responsive now. 

Activator 1.0.2
   Updated for CommonControls

Activator 1.0.1
   UI fix that re-selects the last selected plugin
   so you can toggle between activate and deactivate in the Activator. (Alan Ezust)
