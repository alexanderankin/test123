<h2>Introduction</h2>
With the MetalColor plugin you can customize the colors of the default Metal look and feel.
<br /><br />

<h2>Usage</h2>
First make sure that you have selected the Metal option from "Global Options / Appearance / Swing Look &amp; Feel" and that the Look And Feel plugin is set to None.<br />
<br />
The plugin only consists of an option pane that allows you to choose 3 base colors:
<ul>
<li>Control color, changes controls color like buttons, scroll bars and selected menu</li>
<li>Background color, change background elements color like panels and menus</li>
<li>Text color, which modifies UI controls text color (not in jEdit text area)</li>
</ul>
Just change these colors, press apply to preview then restart jEdit to correct small glitches, voil&agrave;!<br />
