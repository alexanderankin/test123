	<p> QuickOpen is a plugin designed to quickly open any file in the current directory by just typing in a few characters of the filename you want to open. It's similar to CommandT for Vim (https://wincent.com/products/command-t) and TextMate's (http://macromates.com/) quick open ability. Unlike the FastOpen and OpenIt jEdit plugins, it does not use jEdit's ProjectViewer plugin or require you to configure a source path; instead it allows quick opening of the files, including those in the subdirectories, in the currently selected directory in jEdit's file browser. </p>
