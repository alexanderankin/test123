TODO for Jindex
---------------

- merge with CodeAid, SpeedJava or JavaInsight ==> no index necessary at all?!?
- or more than one index file ? (Library of indices, eg. a directory full of index files)
- small JIndex popup: add search textfield
- if nothing found: don't beep, display error message
- "Open JIndex on current word": if no word could be selected,
   open index window with no index selected (instead of beeping)
- option for substituting spaces in URL's by %20
- directory selection dialog for the "doc" field
- inner classes in keyword index: duplicate entries? (a.b.c and b.c and c)
- edit index.html: General info
