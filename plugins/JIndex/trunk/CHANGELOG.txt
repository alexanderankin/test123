ChangeLog for JIndex plugin
===========================================================================

VERSION 1.0

* Now dependent on InfoViewer directly, instead of EditBus
* Requires: jEdit 3.1final, InfoViewer 1.0


VERSION 0.8.2

* Bugfix: #448471 deadlock if index was loaded during "JIndex on current word".
* All source code is now in the "jindex" package.
* Slightly modified Configure dialog.
* The action "Configure..." is now named "JIndex Configuration".
* Requires: jEdit 3.0pre5, EditBus 0.9.4


VERSION 0.8.1

* The index is now loaded and created in the background by using jEdit's
  IO threads. The status of index creation can be watched by the
  IO Progress Monitor.
* Doesn't use EditBus to listen for create/load events any more, uses it's
  own listener.
* Bugfix: deadlocks occurred under some obscure conditions on Windows NT,
  when the index was loaded, locking up jEdit entirely.
* Requires: jEdit 3.0pre5, EditBus 0.9.4


VERSION 0.8

* The index file is now an xml file. Object serialization is not used anymore.
  This should solve any (de)serialization errors on various VM's.
  The disadvantage is that loading takes a little longer.
* Entries for keys are now sorted alphabetically, too.
* Location of split pane divider is saved
* Bugfix: progress bar had wrong size
* Bugfix: non-editable entries in table rendered wrong
* Bugfix: configuration window had wrong position
* Bugfix: deadlock after index creation, if creation was performed after
  "invalidfile" error message
* Requires: jEdit 3.0pre5, EditBus 0.9.4


VERSION 0.7.4

* Bugfix: "JIndex on current word" throws ClassNotFoundException
* Updated to new 2.7pre3 action API
* Requires: jEdit 3.0pre5, EditBus 0.9.4


VERSION 0.7.3

* Switch from PluginHolder to the new jEdit Dockable API.
* New menu entry "Plugins->JIndex->Configure" to configure
  the index directly.
* Other plugins may now use the JIndex API and listen on EditBus
  for index creation and completion.
* Requires: jEdit 2.6pre3, EditBus 0.9.4


VERSION 0.7.2

* Fixed compatibility with jEdit 2.5.1 and PluginHolder 0.0.5
* Index is now lower case
* Requires: jEdit 2.5.1, PluginHolder 0.0.5, EditBus 0.9.4
* InfoViewer 0.5.0 or higher is needed to actually display any API doc.


VERSION 0.7.1

* If the index format has changed and you need to recreate the index, the
  configuration dialog now pops up automatically.
* There _should_ be less memory consumption when creating index
* BugFix: upper/lowercase names appeared twice in index
  (e.g. DATE vs. Date ==> nothing could be found on Date)
  (thanks to Matthias Schneider)
* BugFix: sometimes wrong URLs, when methods have inner classes as parameters.
* Requires: jEdit 2.2final, EditBus 0.8, PluginHolder 0.0.3


VERSION 0.7.0

* There are now three ways of using JIndex:
  - As a standalone window (choose Plugins->JIndex)
  - Docked in the view. Set a check on
    "Global Options->Plugin Options->Plugin Holder->JIndex" and enable
    "Plugins->Plugin Holder->Plugin Holder".
  - Only on demand. Don't open any window or docked panel, just use
    "Plugins->JIndex on current token". If the token is ambiguous, a chooser
    dialog is shown. You can set a keyboard shortcut for this action.
    I recommend S+F1.
* Can now include private or package private members in index. See Option pane.
* Thread safety when loading the index (hopefully!)
* now better works together with PluginHolder
* BugFix: generated wrong doc URLs in some situations. Alas, this forced
  a change in the index structure again. You have to recreate any existing
  index. JIndex is now more helpful to support you with this task.
* BugFix: always ensure, that the doc location ends with '/'
* Requires: jEdit 2.2final, EditBus 0.8, PluginHolder 0.0.3


VERSION 0.6.1

* BugFix: wrong name in dependency on PluginHolder; prevented startup of
  JIndex.
* Requires at least: jEdit 2.2pre9, EditBus 0.8, PluginHolder 0.0.3


VERSION 0.6

* JIndex is now a HoldablePlugin. You need the PluginHolder plugin.
* The menu entry "Plugins->JIndex" just opens the plugin in it's docked
  area. The command "Open JIndex on the current selected word/token" (used
  to be S+F1) is temporarily disabled until the next release.
* Split bar between key list and topic list
* No longer depends directly on InfoViewer (uses messages from the EditBus
  plugin) at compile time. But you need InfoViewer 0.3 or higher to display
  the documentation pages.
* Now listens on messages of type org.gjt.sp.jedit.msg.ShowTokenInfo from
  the EditBus plugin.
* BugFix: no longer adds itself to EditBus (jEdit does this)
* Requires at least: jEdit 2.2pre9, EditBus 0.8, PluginHolder 0.0.3
* InfoViewer 0.3 is recommended.


VERSION 0.5

* The index file is now stored in "<jedithome>/jindex/jindex.ser" instead of
  "<jedithome>/jindex.ser". IMPORTANT: if you want to reuse your old index,
  move the file to the new location before starting jEdit (creating the
  folder "jindex" on the way). If you don't do this, JIndex will ask you to
  create a new index on first use.
* The default shortcut "S+F1" is no longer. You have to set your favorite
  shortcut yourself via "File->Global Options->Shortcuts". The command is
  "JIndex".
* When adding a new library to the index, a dialog box asks for the
  documentation URL.
* BugFix: Progress window was maximized due to Solaris JDK 1.2 bug
* BugFix: Configure dialog couldn't be reached, when Plugin Options window
          was open on JDK 1.2
* BugFix: Tooltips had wrong offset in keyword index
* BugFix: Index creation is now in a more "friendly" thread. Hopefully, this
          resolves some thread errors, that users reported.
* Requires InfoViewerPlugin 0.2 and jEdit 2.2pre8 or higher.

* For developers: JIndex is now an EditBus plugin and accepts messages of
  type "org.gjt.sp.jedit.msg.JIndexSearch". With this message you can send
  search strings like "javax.swing.JLabel" or "getPreferredSize" to JIndex.
  JIndex will display API doc on these classes/methods/fields, if available.
  See org.gjt.sp.jedit.msg.JIndexSearch and jindex.JIndex.search(String) for
  an explanation.
  The message type JIndexSearch is not yet integrated into the EditBus plugin,
  so you need a direct dependancy on JIndex for now, but this will change in
  the future.


VERSION 0.4

* Use the InfoViewerPlugin 0.1. Runs not without.
* Moved to package "jindex" to avoid name clashes.
* The index format has changed (again). You need to recreate the index.
  You get an "ClassNotFoundException: JIndex" if you try to load the old
  index.
* Explicit "Recreate" button in configure dialog.
* BugFix: Tooltips on entries longer than frame were not displayed properly.
* Requires jEdit 2.2pre6 or higher, JDK 1.1 or higher


VERSION 0.3

* Changed configuration dialog in "Plugin Options": now the index has to be
  composed in a second window. When you added or deleted a library, the
  index *must* be recreated (or the dialog can be cancelled, you will loose
  all changes).
* You may change now the location of the documentation folders and the
  "Is old JavaDoc" flag without index recreation.
* The index format has changed. You need to recreate the index.
  Version 0.2 indices become invalid. You will get an error dialog, if you try
  to use the old index before recreation.
* Fixed error in external browser invokation. Chars in the command string
  may now be escaped with '\'.
* Fixed two errors in index generation: wrong signatures on parameters
  with arrays, wrong spaces in param lists for constructors.
* Join the two commands "Open..." and "Open doc on current word" into one.
  So there is just one menu item insteada  a submenu.
* Shortcut is now S+F1 instead of F9 (conflicts with HyperSearch in pre8).
* Minor gui changes (images, help button)
* Requires jEdit 2.2pre6 or higher, JDK 1.1 or higher


VERSION 0.2

* Initial release
* Requires jEdit 2.2pre6 or higher, JDK 1.1 or higher
