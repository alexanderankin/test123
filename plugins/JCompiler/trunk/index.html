<h2>Java Compiler (Kevin A. Burton)</h2>

Java Compiler basically has 3 options:

<ul>

<li>
<p>Build File</p>

<p>Builds the file currently being edited.</p>

<br>
</li>

<li>
<p>Build Package(s) <p>

<p>Builds the package currently being edited.  This is determined by finding out 
the package that the current file is in and then goes it's root directory and
then finds all sub packages.  It does a smart compile in that if you have 
compiled a file and it's .java file hasn't changed then it doesn't recompile it.
</p>

<br>
</li>




<li>
<p>Rebuild Package(s) <p>

<p>Does basically what "Build Package(s)" does but always compiles every file.</p>

<br>
</li>



</ul>
