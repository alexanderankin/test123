- add a progress bar (but where?!?)
  Use the -verbose option with javac to determine the build progress.  Put
  output through a filter and any "[wrote" messages should signal that a file
  has been compiled so you can increase the progress bar by this much.

- Use <java.home>/lib/tools.jar if it could not be found within the current
  classpath.
  NOTE:  This requires JDK 1.2 or higher, because in JDK 1.1 you cannot
  change the classpath of the currently running VM. But this fix is only
  needed in JDK 1.2 anyway.
