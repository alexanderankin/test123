- try to determine the error column by searching for '^' in errors like this:

      home\dirk\jcompiler\JCompilerShell.java:33: Public class \
          jcompiler.JComilerShell must be defined in a file called \
          "JComilerShell.java".
      public class JComilerShell implements Shell, EBComponent {
                   ^

- NullPointerException when compiling under JDK 1.2.2
  (can someone please confirm this?)

- add reload() functionality to FileChangeMonitor()
  currently the set of files is cached. If a file was subsequently added
  to the monitored directory, the FileChangeMonitor won't notice.
  
- add a progress bar (but where?!?)
  Use the -verbose option with javac to determine the build progress.  Put 
  output through a filter and any "[wrote" messages should signal that a file 
  has been compiled so you can increase the progress bar by this much.

- JCompiler should check all the files exist before trying to compile.
  
- If the user is using a target directory, make sure to add it to the 
  classpath so that files put there can be used in other applications
  (NOTE:  This requires JDK 1.2).

- Use java.home/lib/tools.jar if it could not be found within the current
  classpath (NOTE:  This requires JDK 1.2).
