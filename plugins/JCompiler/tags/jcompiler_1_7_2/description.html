<p>The JCompiler plugin allows for compiling java source
files <b>in-process</b>. It does not start a new javac process
and is therefore much faster than compiling in an external
process. It will also include the directory where the
source file resides in the CLASSPATH during
compilation. It can compile a single file or the whole
current package. It will also optionally save the current
buffer or all open buffers before beginning compilation.</p>

<p>Error messages are displayed in the Console and the
ErrorList, allowing error highlighting and one-click
navigation to error lines in the source code.</p>

<p>You may also configure JCompiler to use an external
compiler such as javac, jikes or kjc.</p>

<p>Source- and classpath information may also be managed
by the JavaCore plugin and one of its ClassSource
providers.</p>
