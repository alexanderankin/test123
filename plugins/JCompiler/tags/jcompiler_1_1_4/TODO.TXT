- add a progress bar
  Maybe jEdit's progress monitor can be used for this.
  Use the -verbose option with javac to determine the build progress.  Put
  output through a filter and any "[wrote" messages should signal that a file
  has been compiled so you can increase the progress bar by this much.
  But this is slow.
