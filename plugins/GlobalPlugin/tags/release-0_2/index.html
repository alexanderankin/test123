<h1>GlobalPlugin documentation</h1>
Written by Shlomy Reinstein, July 2007.
<h2>Description</h2>
GlobalPlugin provides jEdit with an interface to the GNU Global, a source code
tag system similar to Cscope. The GlobalPlugin allows you to find the definition
or the references to selected tags in your source code.
For more information about GNU Global, visit
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/global">the GNU Global website</a>.
<h2>Installation</h2>
To use GlobalPlugin, you must first install GNU Global. You can download the
tool from <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/global/download.html">
the GNU Global website</a>.
<br>
Next, either add the 'global' executable to your path, or specify the path to
it in the GlobalPlugin options.
<h2>Usage</h2>
GNU Global reads tag information from database files created by the 'gtags'
tool, which is normally installed as part of the GNU Global package. In order
to use the GlobalPlugin, you should first create the database files. This is
done simply by running 'gtags' at the root directory of your project. Running
'gtags' will scan your directory tree for source files and generate several
database files in the directory where you ran it. (For more information, visit
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/global/globaldoc_toc.html">the GNU Global
website</a>.)
<br>
Once the database has been created, you can start using GlobalPlugin: Simply
select a tag in a jEdit buffer, then invoke one of the items from the
GlobalPlugin menu. Each of the menu item will open a dockable window with the
requested information, retrieved from GNU Global.
<h3>Notes</h3>
The 'Call Tree' dockable window is a special feature that is not provided
directly by GNU Global, but rather inferred from multiple queries of GNU Global.
The algorithm of 'Call Tree' is simple:
<ol>
<li>Run "global" to get the list of references to the selected tag.</li>
<li>For each reference, run "global" to get the list of definitions in the file
containing the reference.</li>
<li>Present the bottomost definition that is above the reference line as a "caller".
</li>
</ol>
Although the 'call tree' may be very handy, it is far from being accurate for
several reasons:
<ul>
<li>The bottomost definition above the reference line is not necessarily a function
definition, in which case it's not really a "caller".</li>
<li>GNU Global lists function declarations in header files in the list of references
to the function. Of course, function declarations are not "calls" to the function,
but GlobalPlugin has no way of telling the difference, so it will use the same
algorithm and present the tag defined above the declaration as a "caller".</li>
</ul>
<h3>Enjoy!</h3>
