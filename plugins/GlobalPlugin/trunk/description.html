GlobalPlugin provides an interface to the GNU Global source tagging tool:
http://www.gnu.org/software/global
It provides a static function call tree using Global. The call tree is not
context-sensitive since it is generated from references to plain function
names. Hence, although it can be used for all the languages supported by Global,
it is most useful for C than for object oriented languages.
