GlobalPlugin provides an interface to the GNU Global source tagging tool:
http://www.gnu.org/software/global
It provides dockables for viewing:
1. A static function call tree
2. A list of definitions of a symbol
3. A list of references to a symbol
All this information is extracted from GNU Global. As such, it is not context-
sensitive and therefore more useful with non object-oriented languages such as
C.
