	<chapter id="overview"><title>Overview</title>
		<para>
			The Python Shell plugin maintains an interactive Python environment within jEdit.
			This can be useful for running quick tests, or simply to play around with the language
			to get a better feel for its syntax.
		</para>
		<para>
			To use the plugin, open up the Console dockable and select the Python shell.
			Once selected, it will attempt to start up the Read-Eval-Print-Loop, and if successful,
			the Python information message and prompt will be displayed. If not successful,
			you will need to tell the plugin where to find Python; this can be done by going to
			Plugins -> Plugin Options -> Python Shell. This should only be necessary if the Python
			executable can not be found on your system path.
		</para>
	</chapter>
	<chapter id="interpreters"><title>Specifying Interpreters</title>
		<para>
			The plugin supports specifying multiple Python interpreters in the Plugin Options menu.
			By default, only one interpreter is provided, which is simply the command "python".
			Others can be added easily, and can be switched to in the Plugins menu. Switching
			to a different interpreter will restart the current session if one is already running.
		</para>
		<para>
			For each interpreter, you may also define a list of parameters to pass in when it is
			started. Be aware when adding parameters that no advanced parsing is done on them,
			so quoted strings will not work as expected. In addition, the "-i" parameter (inspect
			interactively) is always passed in and never needs to be specified; if the plugin detects
			ipython as the interpreter, then "-noreadline" is passed in as well.
		</para>
		<para>
			NOTE: some Python implementations may not work with this plugin. IronPython, for example,
			fails for God knows what reason. All testing has been done with the default interpreter,
			so if you run into any problems using a different one, try switching to the default
			interpreter provided by python.org.
		</para>
	</chapter>
	<chapter id="actions"><title>Evaluating Code</title>
		<para>
			The easiest way to evaluate code in the shell is to simply type it in and hit enter.
			But there are several actions available that make it easier to test a portion of your
			code without having to manually copy and paste it.
		</para>
		<para>
			These actions can be found in Plugins -> Python Shell. Using these actions, you can
			use the shell to evaluate the active buffer, any selected text within that buffer, 
			or an external Python script.
		</para>
		<para>
			Any variables or functions defined in the shell will persist until the loop is
			manually stopped and restarted.
		</para>
	</chapter>
	<chapter id="stop-restart"><title>Stopping and Restarting</title>
		<para>
			To stop the loop, click on the Stop button in the Console dockable. After it's stopped,
			hit Enter to start it back up again. Restarting can be used to reset the environment,
			or you can simply stop the loop to conserve system resources.
		</para>
