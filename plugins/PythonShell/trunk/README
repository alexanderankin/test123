ABOUT THIS PLUGIN
-----------------

This is the first in a series of plugins designed to implement various
Read-Eval-Print-Loops within jEdit. Each one will be implemented as a new
shell in Console and will have similar functionality.

This is essentially the "breaking up" of the Slime plugin. The original intent
was to provide a single plugin that would allow any REPL to be implemented
as a shell, but in the interest of saving disk space and reducing plugin
overheads, each REPL will be released as a separate, yet similarly structured,
plugin.

For java-based languages, there will be some coordination with the
ScriptEnginePlugin to provide interaction (and possibly dependencies) between
the two.
