XSearch is an extended search plugin, that provides a replacement
for the built-in jEdit search/replace dialogs. It has awareness of the
ProjectViewer plugin, and can restrict its search to the project file set.
It includes and uses gnu.regexp, an older, unsupported,
regular expression library, as an alternative to Sun's java.util.regex.
Each has its own quirks and a slightly different syntax, so keep that in
mind when doing regex search/replace.
