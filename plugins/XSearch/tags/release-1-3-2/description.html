XSearch is an extended search plugin, that provides a replacement for the built-in jEdit search/replace dialogs. It has awareness of the ProjectViewer plugin, and can restrict its search to the project file set. It uses gnu.regexp, instead of java.util.regex, which means it supports a slightly different syntax, and uses a different algorithm, which some say is more robust.
