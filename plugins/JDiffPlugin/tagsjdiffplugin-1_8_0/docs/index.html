<a name="usage">
    <h3>Usage</h3>

    <p>The simplest method is to open the Dual Diff Dialog
    (Plugins -&gt; JDiff -&gt; <b>Show dual diff dialog</b>)
    and choose the files to compare.
    </p>
    <p>
    But you can also:<br>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Split your view in two (vertically)</p></li>

        <li><p>Edit the buffers you want to compare:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><p>the buffer on the left is the original</p></li>
                <li><p>the buffer on the right is the revision</p></li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li><p>Activate JDiff:
            <guimenu>Plugins</guimenu>&gt;
            <guisubmenu>JDiff</guisubmenu>&gt;
            <b>Dual Diff</b> </p>
        </li>
    </ol>
    </p>

    <p>
    Or if you have JDiff docked:<br>
    <ol>
      <li>Open the dockable.</li>
      <li>Click the 'Diff' button: <br><img src="delta.png"></img></li>
    </ol>
    </p>

    <p>Figure 1 shows the result</p>

            <img src="diff_overview.jpg" format="JPG">

<a name="display">
    <h3>Display</h3>

    <p>Once JDiff is activated as in Figure 1, you should see:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><p>Text Highlights</p></li>
        <li><p>A local overview (right of the original)</p></li>
        <li><p>A global overview (right of the revision)</p></li>
        <li><p>If you have activated the Diff dockable, you'll also see the merge controls and the line overview.</p></li>
    </ul>


        <h3>Color conventions</h3>

        <p>By default:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><p>Changed lines appear in yellow</p></li>
            <li><p>Deleted (from the original) lines appear in red</p></li>
            <li><p>Inserted (to the revision) lines appear in green</p></li>

            <li><p>Invalid lines appear as thin dark grey lines.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><p>In the original, invalid lines indicate where a block was inserted
                in the revision.</p>
                </li>
                <li><p>In the revision, invalid lines indicate where a block was deleted in
                the original. </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Local overview</h3>

        <p>
        The local overview shows how the visible changed/inserted/deleted
        blocks from the original and the revision relate to each other. Merging
        between files can be performed by clicking
        a right arrow in the local overview, which will select the corresponding text
        from the original and replace the related text in the revision.  Clicking
        a left arrow in the local overview will select the corresponding text
        from the revision and replace the related text in the original.
        </p>

        <h3>Global overview</h3>

        <p>
        The global overview should help you estimate how the two edited buffers
        differ.
        It also displays two cursors which indicate the visible parts of the two
        buffers.
        Clicking within the global overview will move the view to the corresponding
        part of the file.
        </p>

        <h3>Line overview</h3>
        <p>
        The line overview shows character-by-character differences between the
        current cursor lines.
        </p>

        <h3>Merge controls</h3>
        <p>
        The merge control has 8 buttons.  From left to right in horizontal mode:
        </p>
        <p>
        <ol>
        <li>Start a diff.</li>
        <li>Unsplit the view, which ends the diff session.</li>
        <li>Move to next diff.</li>
        <li>Move current diff to right.  This replaces the diff on the right
        with the text from the left diff.</li>
        <li>Move current diff to left.  This replaces the diff on the left
        with the text from the right diff.</li>
        <li>Move to previous diff.</li>
        <li>Swap text areas, that is, put the file that was on the left on
        the right, and put the file that was on the right on the left.</li>
        <li>Refresh the diff.</li>
        </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
        The merge controls can also be displayed vertically or in a compact form, and with or without the line overview.  The vertical display is convenient for the left or right docking areas.  The horizontal layout works well in the top or bottom docking areas.  The compact layout uses less vertical space in the top or bottom docking areas when the line overview is also displayed.
        </p>

<a name="options">
    <h3>Options</h3>


        <h3>Line comparison options</h3>

        <p>You can configure how JDiff compares lines by default. JDiff can:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><p>
                Ignore case: upper-cased lines are compared.
            </p></li>

            <li><p>
                Ignore leading and trailing whitespace: lines are compared as if
                leading and trailing whitespaces were removed.
            </p></li>

            <li><p>
                Ignore amount of whitespace: lines are compared as if any</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>leading and trailing whitespaces were removed</p></li>
                    <li><p>sequence of whitespaces were replaced by one single space.</p></li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li><p>
                Ignore all whitespace: lines are compared as if any
                <ul>
                    <li><p>leading, trailing and inner whitespaces were removed</p></li>
                </ul>
            </p></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Control layout</h3>
        <p>
        Automatically display dockable on diff: When starting a new diff from the plugin menu, if on, this setting will cause the diff dockable to be displayed immediately so the merge controls are quickly accessible.
        </p>
        <p>
        Show line diffs in dockable:  Toggles display of the line diff in the dockable.  Turning this off will reduce the amount of screen space the dockable occupies.
        </p>
        <p>
        Merge control layout<br>
        <ul>
        <li>Horizontal: default, merge control buttons in a single horizontal line.  Best used docked at top or bottom.</li>
        <li>Vertical: merge controls in a single vertical line. Best used docked at the left or right. Not a good choice when the line overview is also on.</li>
        <li>Compact: merge controls in 2 columns of 4 buttons.  Occupies smallest amount of screen space when used with the line overview.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>Overview colors</h3>

        <p>You can configure the colors of:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><p>Changed lines</p></li>
            <li><p>Deleted lines</p></li>
            <li><p>Inserted lines</p></li>
            <li><p>Invalid lines</p></li>
            <li><p>Left cursor in the global overview</p></li>
            <li><p>Right cursor in the global overview</p></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Highlight colors</h3>

        <p>You can configure the colors of:</p>

        <ul>

            <li><p>Deleted lines</p></li>
            <li><p>Inserted lines</p></li>
            <li><p>Invalid lines</p></li>
