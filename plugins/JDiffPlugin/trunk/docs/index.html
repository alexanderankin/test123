<a name="usage">

<h3>Usage</h3>

<p>The simplest method is to open the Dual Diff Dialog (Plugins
-&gt; JDiff -&gt; <b>Show dual diff dialog</b>) and choose the
files to compare.</p>

<p>But you can also:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Split your view in two (vertically)</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Edit the buffers you want to compare:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>the buffer on the left is the original</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>the buffer on the right is the revision</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p>Activate JDiff: <b>Plugins</b> &gt; <b>JDiff</b>&gt; <b>Dual
Diff</b></p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>Or if you have JDiff docked:</p>

<ol>
<li>Open the dockable.</li>

<li>Click the 'Diff' button:

<p><img alt="" src="delta.png"></p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>Figure 1 shows the result</p>

<img alt="" src="diff_overview.jpg" format="JPG">

<h3>Display</h3>

<p>Once JDiff is activated as in Figure 1, you should see:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Text Highlights</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>A local overview (right of the original)</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>A global overview (right of the revision)</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>If you have activated the Diff dockable, you'll also see the
merge controls and the line overview.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Color conventions</h3>

<p>By default:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Changed lines appear in yellow</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Deleted (from the original) lines appear in red</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Inserted (to the revision) lines appear in green</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Invalid lines appear as thin dark grey lines.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>In the original, invalid lines indicate where a block was
inserted in the revision.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>In the revision, invalid lines indicate where a block was
deleted in the original.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Local overview</h3>

<p>The local overview shows how the visible
changed/inserted/deleted blocks from the original and the
revision relate to each other. Merging between files can be
performed by clicking a right arrow in the local overview, which
will select the corresponding text from the original and replace
the related text in the revision. The blocks to be merged are
indicated by vertical black bars so it is obvious which code is
moving. Clicking a left arrow in the local overview will select
the corresponding text block from the revision and replace the
related text in the original. Note that the code moves are by
block, not by line, so the entire diff will be moved.</p>

<h3>Global overview</h3>

<p>The global overview should help you estimate how the two
edited buffers differ. It also displays two cursors which
indicate the visible parts of the two buffers. Clicking within
the global overview will move the view to the corresponding part
of the file.</p>

<h3>Line overview</h3>

<p>The line overview shows character-by-character differences
between the current cursor lines within a diff block. This makes
it easy to see the difference of even a single character change
between the left and right lines. This overview only shows one
line at a time of the diff block, move the cursor within the
block to see the individual line differences for each line.</p>

<h3>Merge controls</h3>

<p>The merge control has 8 buttons. From left to right in
horizontal mode:</p>

<ol>
<li><img alt="" src="diff.jpg">&nbsp; Start a diff.</li>

<li><img alt="" src="unsplit.jpg"> &nbsp; Unsplit the view, which
ends the diff session.</li>

<li><img alt="" src="next_diff.jpg">&nbsp; Move to next
diff.</li>

<li><img alt="" src="move_right.jpg">&nbsp; Move current diff to
right. This replaces the diff block on the right with the text
from the left diff block.</li>

<li><img alt="" src="move_left.jpg">&nbsp; Move current diff to
left. This replaces the diff block on the left with the text from
the right diff block.</li>

<li><img alt="" src="prev_diff.jpg">&nbsp; Move to previous
diff.</li>

<li><img alt="" src="swap.jpg">&nbsp; Swap text areas, that is,
put the file that was on the left on the right, and put the file
that was on the right on the left.</li>

<li><img alt="" src="refresh.jpg">&nbsp; Refresh the diff.</li>
</ol>

<p>The merge controls can also be displayed vertically or in a
compact form (as shown in the image above), and with or without
the line overview. The vertical display is convenient for the
left or right docking areas. The horizontal layout works well in
the top or bottom docking areas. The compact layout uses less
vertical space in the top or bottom docking areas when the line
overview is also displayed.</p>

<hr>
<a name="other_commands">

<h3>Other commands</h3>

<p>These commands are available on the plugin menu:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><b>Refresh</b>: refreshes the diff display</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><b>Go to previous/next difference</b></p>
</li>

<li>
<p><b>Ignore case</b>: toggles the "Ignore case" option for the
current diff</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><b>Ignore leading and trailing whitespace</b>: toggles the
"Ignore leading and trailing whitespace" option for the current
diff</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><b>Ignore amount of whitespace</b>: toggles the "Ignore amount
of whitespace" option for the current diff</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><b>Ignore all whitespace</b>: toggles the "Ignore all
whitespace" option for the current diff</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><b>Normal Diff Output</b>: generates a diff file using the
normal method</p>
</li>
</ul>

<hr>
<a name="options">

<h3>Options</h3>

<p>These settings can be made in the JDiff options panel, Plugins
-&gt; Plugin Options... -&gt; JDiff Plugin</p>

<h3>Line comparison options</h3>

<p>You can configure how JDiff compares lines by default. JDiff
can:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Ignore case: upper-cased lines are compared.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Ignore leading and trailing whitespace: lines are compared as
if leading and trailing whitespaces were removed.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Ignore amount of whitespace: lines are compared as if any</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>leading and trailing whitespaces were removed</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>sequence of whitespaces were replaced by one single space.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p>Ignore all whitespace: lines are compared as if:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>any leading, trailing and inner whitespaces were removed</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Control layout</h3>

<p>Automatically display dockable on diff: When starting a new
diff from the plugin menu, if on, this setting will cause the
diff dockable to be displayed immediately so the merge controls
are quickly accessible.</p>

<p>Show line diffs in dockable: Toggles display of the line diff
in the dockable. Turning this off will reduce the amount of
screen space the dockable occupies.</p>

<p>Merge control layout</p>

<ul>
<li>Horizontal: default, merge control buttons in a single
horizontal line. Best used docked at top or bottom.</li>

<li>Vertical: merge controls in a single vertical line. Best used
docked at the left or right. Not a good choice when the line
overview is also on.</li>

<li>Compact: merge controls in 2 columns of 4 buttons. Occupies
smallest amount of screen space when used with the line
overview.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Overview colors</h3>

<p>You can configure the colors of:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Changed lines</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Deleted lines</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Inserted lines</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Invalid lines</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Left cursor in the global overview</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Right cursor in the global overview</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Highlight colors</h3>

<p>You can configure the colors of:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Changed lines</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Deleted lines</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Inserted lines</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Invalid lines</p>
</li>
</ul>
