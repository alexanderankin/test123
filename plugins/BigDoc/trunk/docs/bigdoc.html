   <h2>BigDoc Plugin</h2>
   <h3>Dale Anson</h3>
   <p>A plugin to view really large text files, up to 2 GB in size. This is 
   intended for TEXT files. Binary files (yes, I know text files are technically
   binary, but you know what I mean) are detected using the standard jEdit binary
   detection method and will not be opened since they can cause jEdit to hang due
   to byte conversion shenanigans.</p>
   
   <p>Open a file with the plugin File - Open menu item.</p>
   
   <p>There is a "Find" command, it works well.</p>
   
   <p>There are no other editing tools, all you can do is look at file contents.
   You can search, you can select and copy, but that's it for now.</p>
   
   <p>I spent a lot of time trying to figure out how to adapt the code in this
   plugin to work with jEdit itself, so that jEdit could open giant files, but
   it turns out that would require a huge rewrite of jEdit and not many people
   are really asking to be able to load large files.</p>
   
   <p>The largest file I've opened was about 1.3 GB, it opened easily and did not
   cause any out of memory errors.</p>
