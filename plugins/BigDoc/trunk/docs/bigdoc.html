   <h2>BigDoc Plugin</h2>
   <h3>Dale Anson</h3>
   <p>A plugin to view really large text files, like hundreds of MBs or maybe even
   a few GBs. Provides crappy syntax highlighting for xml and html files.</p>
   <p>Open a file with the plugin File - Open menu item.</p>
   <p>If it is an XML or HTML file, it will have some crappy syntax highlighting
   that should be similar to the colors that you would see if you opened the same file
   in jEdit's text area, but no, it's not like that.</p>
   <p>Settings like caret color, background color, bracket highlight, etc, are
   the same as those used in the jEdit text area.</p>
   <p>There is a "Find" command, it works pretty well, but I wish I could get the
   jEdit hypersearch to work.</p>
   <p>There are no other editing tools, all you can do is look at a file's contents.
   You can search, you can select and copy, but that's it for now. Oh, rectangular
   selection works fairly well in case you need to copy a column of something.</p>
   <p>I spent a lot of time trying to figure out how to adapt the code in this
   plugin to work with jEdit itself, so that jEdit could open giant files, but
   it turns out that would require a huge rewrite of jEdit and not many people
   are really asking to be able to load large files.</p>
   <p>The largest file I've opened was about 80 MB, it opened easily and did not
   cause any out of memory errors, however, moving the caret with the keyboard did,
   but everything recovered fairly quickly. That file was an html file, so syntax
   highlighting was in effect. Maybe I should add an option to turn that off?</p>
