This jEdit plugin enables you to load documents from a WebDAV server into 
a jEdit buffer and to save the content of a buffer to the remote WebDAV collection. 
Collections (= directories) can be created and deleted via the jEdit File Browser. 
With this plugin you can directly edit documents in databases or in web folders.
