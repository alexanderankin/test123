	The plugin was written by James Glaubiger and Marshall Clark as part of
	a final project while attending the University Of California Santa Cruz.
	There were two iterations of the project, the second of which was completed
	as part of an independent study under Professor Jim Whitehead.

	(Web-based Distributed Authoring and Versioning) protocol.
	
	In 2004 the plugin code was transferred to GitHub
	(https://github.com/marklogic/webdavjedit) and has been maintained
	by MarkLogic (http://www.marklogic.com).
