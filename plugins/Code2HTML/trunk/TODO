--                          TODO for version 0.6                              --
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Need to follow the @todo tags in several files
+ Add gutter font size to style sheet (view.gutter.fontsize)
+ change gutter object from span to something more line-expansive - nested span
* Work out what the code does in obfuscated bits, no time ATM
* Link th estandalone code with jEdit. It is already required to even start so
    it should be painless (probably... maybe... just a bit)
    * Code should at the very least be copied and exported (symlinked) from main
        jEdit trunk - better, require jedit.jar in ${CLASSPATH}.
    * Make scripts to run the standalone Code2HTML command
* Make better docs
    * Include javadoc in help file ?
    * prettyfy help file a bit
+ Check that I got rid of all hardcoded \n's - Firefox problem: \r\n is
    interpreted as \n\n when inside <pre> tags. Hardcode \n's all over again!
    + Better yet - put \n as a property in props file
* Clean up code in html package
    * Make abstract gutter class; style class & make {CSS/HTML}{Gutter/Style}
        subclass it
* Add ant target to reload plugin
* Fix the <span class="some>word</span> <span class="some">after</span>
    duplication in generated code
