--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Need to follow the @todo tags in several files
* Work out what the code does in obfuscated bits, no time ATM
* Link th estandalone code with jEdit. It is already required to even start so
    it should be painless (probably... maybe... just a bit)
    * Code should at the very least be copied and exported (symlinked) from main
        jEdit trunk.
* Make better docs
    * Include javadoc in help file
    * prettyfy help file a bit
* Check that I got rid of all hardcoded \n's
* Clean up code in html package
* Add ant target to reload plugin
* Fix the <span class="some>word</span> <span class="some">after</span>
    duplication in generated code
