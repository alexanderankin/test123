CandyFolds draws colored indentation-guides on the text-area to improve code readability. An indentation-guide is a vertical line drawn following the text indentation. The color used by each indentation-guide can be configured using regular expressions: the regular expression tests the line of text on the starting point of the indentation, if it matches then the specified color is used to draw the indentation-guide.
<p> CandyFolds was based on the WhiteSpace (by Nathan Jones and Andre Kaplan) plugin's fold-guides.
