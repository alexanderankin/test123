CandyFolds draws colored fold-guides on the text-area to improve code readability. A fold-guide is a vertical line drawn from the start to the end of a fold, following the text indentation. The color used by each fold-guide can be configured using regular expressions: the regular expression tests the line of text on the starting point of the fold, if it matches then it uses the specified color to draw the fold-guide.
<p> CandyFolds was based on the WhiteSpace (by Nathan Jones and Andre Kaplan) plugin's fold-guides.
