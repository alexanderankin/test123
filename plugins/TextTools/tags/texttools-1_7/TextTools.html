<h1>[ TextTools ]</h1>

<p>by mike dillon &lt;mdillon@jedit.org&gt;</p>

<p>The TextTools plugin provides a set of plugin actions for manipulating text
in a buffer.</p>

<h3>TextTools actions</h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href="#Sort">Sort</a></li>
	<li><a href="#RevSort">Reverse Sort</a></li>
	<li><a href="#FieldSort">Field Sort</a></li>
	<li><a href="#Shuffle">Shuffle</a></li>
	<li><a href="#TransposeChars">Transpose Characters</a></li>
	<li><a href="#TransposeLines">Transpose Lines</a></li>
	<li><a href="#TransposeWords">Transpose Words</a></li>
</ul>


<p><strong><a name="Sort">Sort</a></strong>
by mike dillon &lt;mdillon@jedit.org&gt;</p>

<p>This action sorts all selected lines in lexicographic order.  If no text is
selected, it sorts the entire buffer. If the selection begins or ends in the
middle of a line, the entire line is sorted.</p>


<p><strong><a name="RevSort">Reverse Sort</a></strong>
by mike dillon &lt;mdillon@jedit.org&gt;</p>

<p>Same as <a href="#Sort">Sort</a>, except the sorted lines are inserted in
reverse order.</p>


<p><strong><a name="FieldSort">Field Sort</a></strong>
by Carmine Lucarelli &lt;carmine@jedit.org&gt;</p>

<p>Brings up a dialog where you can specify which fields to use and how those fields should be sorted.<br>
<strong>N.B. Make sure to 'step off' the last cell you edit, or else your change will be ignored</strong><br>
Globally you can specify whether to delete duplicate entries in the data.<br>
For each of the fields you create, you can specify:
<ul>
<li>
  the start column (indexed starting at 1)
</li>
<li>
  the end column
</li>
<li>
  whether the field should be sorted in an ascending or descending order
</li>
<li>
  whether case should be ignored
</li>
<li>
  whether 'smart' number sorting should be done (selecting this option would place File2 before File10 in the sort)
</li>
<li>
  whether whitespace at the start or end of the field should be ignored
</li>
</ul>
</p>


<p><strong><a name="Shuffle">Shuffle Lines</a></strong>
by Carmine Lucarelli &lt;carmine@jedit.org&gt;</p>

<p>Randomize the data, in effect 'unsorting' it.</p>


<p><strong><a name="TransposeChars">Transpose Characters</a></strong>
by mike dillon &lt;mdillon@jedit.org&gt;</p>

<p>Transposes the characters on either side of the cursor. At the either end of
a line, it transposes the two characters nearest the cursor.</p>


<p><strong><a name="TransposeLines">Transpose Lines</a></strong>
by mike dillon &lt;mdillon@jedit.org&gt;</p>

<p>Transposes the current line with the preceding line. If there is no
preceding line, the current line is transposed with the following line.</p>


<p><strong><a name="TransposeWords">Transpose Words</a></strong>
by mike dillon &lt;mdillon@jedit.org&gt;</p>

<p>Transposes the nearest word to the cursor (which i'll call the "pivot" word)
with one of the adjacent words. If there is a word before the pivot, the pivot
will be transposed with that word; otherwise, it will be transposed with the
following word. The intervening non-word sequence is left between the
transposed words. All letters and digits, in addition to any character in the
"noWordSep" Buffer property (which is typically defined by the Buffer's current
mode), are considered word characters. All other characters are not. If a
transposition takes place, the cursor is placed after the transposed
sequence.</p>
