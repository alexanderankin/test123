<h1>[ TextTools ]</h1>

<p>by mike dillon &lt;mdillon@jedit.org&gt;</p>

<p>The TextTools plugin provides a set of plugin actions for manipulating text
in a buffer.</p>

<h3>TextTools actions</h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href="#Sort">Sort</a></li>
	<li><a href="#RevSort">Reverse Sort</a></li>
	<li><a href="#TransposeChars">Transpose Characters</a></li>
	<li><a href="#TransposeLines">Transpose Lines</a></li>
	<li><a href="#TransposeWords">Transpose Words</a></li>
</ul>


<p><strong><a name="Sort">Sort</a></strong>
by mike dillon &lt;mdillon@jedit.org&gt;</p>

<p>This action sorts all selected lines in lexicographic order.  If no text is
selected, it sorts the entire buffer. If the selection begins or ends in the
middle of a line, the entire line is sorted.</p>


<p><strong><a name="RevSort">Reverse Sort</a></strong>
by mike dillon &lt;mdillon@jedit.org&gt;</p>

<p>Same as <a href="#Sort">Sort</a>, except the sorted lines are inserted in
reverse order.</p>


<p><strong><a name="TransposeChars">Transpose Characters</a></strong>
by mike dillon &lt;mdillon@jedit.org&gt;</p>

<p>Transposes the characters on either side of the cursor. At the either end of
a line, it transposes the two characters nearest the cursor.</p>


<p><strong><a name="TransposeLines">Transpose Lines</a></strong>
by mike dillon &lt;mdillon@jedit.org&gt;</p>

<p>Transposes the current line with the preceding line. If there is no
preceding line, the current line is transposed with the following line.</p>


<p><strong><a name="TransposeWords">Transpose Words</a></strong>
by mike dillon &lt;mdillon@jedit.org&gt;</p>

<p>Transposes the nearest word to the cursor (which i'll call the "pivot" word)
with one of the adjacent words. If there is a word before the pivot, the pivot
will be transposed with that word; otherwise, it will be transposed with the
following word. The intervening non-word sequence is left between the
transposed words. All letters and digits, in addition to any character in the
"noWordSep" Buffer property (which is typically defined by the Buffer's current
mode), are considered word characters. All other characters are not. If a
transposition takes place, the cursor is placed after the transposed
sequence.</p>
