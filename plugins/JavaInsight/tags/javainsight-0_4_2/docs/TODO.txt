TODO


- Ability to use reflection and see the methods within a class... then you
  can expand this class.
  Use the JBrowse code to render the class nodes.

- Add support for showing the user where a specific class was loaded from.

- Ability to change the classpath, and reparse it and all its jars.
  This can be done easily by just adding support within PackageBrowser
  and also adding a button to JavaInsight's JPanel.

- Ability to cache all documents. When the user reparses the classpath
  then all .class files should be re-generated

- Ability to view by classname
