The JavaInsight plugin adds an action to the file system browser that lets
you decompile selected Java classes this can be done either using the Jode or the Procyon decompiler.
<p/>
Of the 2 decompilers Procyon is the more up to date, with a better handling of features introduced from Java 5 onwards. 
<p/>
Furthermore it adds some actions to view selected classes in disassembled
form, either BCEL or Jasmin output.
