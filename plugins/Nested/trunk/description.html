		The nested plugin allows to control the background color of 
		a chunk of code that is not the same language as the 
		language of the buffer. For example java code inside a jsp file, ...
		
		The settings are stored in the plugin directory in a file called 
		<code>settings.txt</code> that looks like the one below, one line 
		per association mode,submode,color (in hex format)
		
<pre style="border:1px solid black">
jaxx,java,#ccff99
jsp,java,#ffffff
</pre>
		
		When a new file that contain sub languages is open in jedit, 
		the nested plugin will detect it and add a line to the settings, 
		the color is chosen to be the same as the default view background
		so that by default, the buffer looks exactly the same as if the
		plugin was not there.
		
		The plugin also provides a dockable window that displays the 
		current settings in a table, one line per settings. The user 
		can change the color for a particular setting by clicking on the 
		color column (third column) of the table.
