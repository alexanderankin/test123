<body>
The InputReplace plugin provides a facility for expanding input character sequences
into replacement text, similar to abbreviations but without the requirement of
expanding a whole word at a time. It is useful for inserting characters not found
in your keyboard layout, such as turning "e'" into "é" or "c/" into "¢".
<p/>
The primary advantage over jEdit's built-in abbreviations is that these
replacements can be used within words, rather than just with whole words.
<p/>
This allows you to define, say, a single replacement e' → é and use it to
quickly enter both café and débutante. To enter café, you would type cafe' and
activate "Input Replace at Caret" after the whole word; to enter débutante, you
would type de', activate "Input Replace at Caret", and then finish typing the
word.
<p/>
One can also define custom BeanShell functions to perform more complicated replacements.
