<h1>Introduction</h1>
The AntFarm plugin provides quick access to Ant build files from within
jEdit. 
<p>AntFarm has five main features:<br>
<ol>
<li>View the structure of an Ant build file.</li>
<li>Dynamically parse Ant build files and display errors.</li>
<li>Run Ant targets from within jEdit.</li>
<li>Integration with the Console plugin.</li>
<li>Access to the Ant build files assets.</li>
</ol>

Ant is a Java based make tool developed by the Apache Ant project. The
Apache software itself is included in another plugin, called the
AntPlugin.
<p>
For help writing Ant build files, please refer to <a href="jeditresource:/AntPlugin.jar!/index.html" >AntPlugin</a> online help,
which is simply the Ant users guide.

<h2>Configuring Ant Farm</h2>
To configure Ant Farm, access Global Options -> Plugin Options -> Ant
Farm -> Build Options.
<p>
Ant Farm can be configured to run builds within the current JVM or
outside of the current JVM using a shell script. Using the current JVM
is faster but large build tasks may not have enough memory to execute
properly. Also, complex Ant scripts that require multiple external
resources might not run properly from the current JVM.
<p>
If you experience OutOfMemory exceptions when running builds in the same
JVM, increase the size of the java heap when running jEdit, or use an
external script. To increase the heap size, use the -mx&lt;size&gt;m java
command line option when starting jEdit, where &lt;size&gy; indicates the
amount of memory to be assigned.
<p>
When you attempt to run an Ant build without having configured you build
preferences, you will be prompted to select whether you wish to use the
current JVM or an external script.
<p>
If you choose to run Ant builds within the current JVM, additional
classpath elements can be specified when needed. This allows Ant to
locate classes required for execution. This is useful when using custom
tasks and external libraries not loaded by JEdit.
<p>
To run Ant builds outside of the current JVM, specify the build file you
wish to use. Default build files for multiple operating systems are
included with the binary distribution of the Apache Ant project.
Additionally, you can specify global properties that will be passed to
Ant. 
<p>
Access Global Options -> Plugin Options -> Ant Farm -> Properties,
and enter the name/value pairs for the properties you need. Ant Farm
will prompt you for runtime properties each time you run a target. To
turn this feature off, click Do not prompt for properties when running
targets. Properties specified at target runtime are not added to the
global properties list.
<p>
Ant Farm can automatically load build.xml files from the root of any
projects you manage via the Project Viewer. To enable this, check Load
build files from the Project Viewer plugin, make sure the Project Viewer
is docked so it starts immediately with jEdit and restart jEdit. Now,
whenever you switch to a project that contains a file named build.xml,
it will be loaded into Ant Farm.
<p>
Ant Farm also automatically loads any file named build.xml that is
opened for editing.
<p>
When running an Ant target, the name of each task is prepended to the
output text by default. To avoid this and print output in emacs friendly
mode, check Produce logging information without adornments (Emacs mode).
Ant Farm can save all currently changed buffers whenever you execute a
target. To turn this feature on, check Save all buffers before running a
target.

<h2>View the structure of an Ant build file.</h2>
Plugins>AntFarm displays the AntFarm window. This window is floating by
default, but can be made to dock into the view in the Docking pane of
the Global Options dialog box.
<p>
The AntFarm window consists of a toolbar which manages the different
build files you work with and a tree which displays the structure of the
build files you have added. The tree displays the name attribute of the
Ant project, if provided, and all defined targets of the project.
In addition to the toolbar buttons, different functions can be accessed
by right clicking on each item in the tree.
<p>
<h2>The AntFarm tool bar</h2>
Each button on the toolbar shows a tooltip if the mouse pointer is held
over it long enough. Here is a description of each button:
<dl>
<dt>Add</dt> 
<dd>- provides a file chooser dialog box which allows you to chose the
Ant build file you want to work with. Multiple build files can be added
to the tree.
<p>
The traditional name for an Ant build file is build.xml. In addition
to the Add button, AntFarm is setup to automatically load any file named
build.xml into the tree.
<p>
In addition, AntFarm contains the option to load build.xml files from
any project you may manage using the Project Viewer plugin. To activate
this feature, check Global Options -> Plugin Options -> Ant Farm -> Load
build files from the Project Viewer plugin.
</dd>
<dt>Remove</dt><dd>- removes the currently selected build file from the tree. This
does not affect the build file itself in any way.</dd>
<p>
<dt>Run</dt><dd> - runs the current target that is selected in the tree. If the
currently selected item is a project, AntFarm will run the default
target for that build file.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
<h2>Dynamically parse Ant build files and display errors.</h2>
Ant build files are defined using XML. When a build file is added to the
AntFarm, its structure is parsed and the targets are displayed in the
tree. If an error is encountered while parsing, a message will be
displayed in the tree and an entry will be sent to the ErrorList plugin.
The ErrorList entry provides quick access to the line that caused the
problem in the build file when a line number is available.
<p>
When changes are made and saved to a build file that is loaded in
AntFarm, the tree will be reparsed and updated to display the current
status of the file. Just as in loading, any errors will be caught and
displayed via the tree and the ErrorList. This feature provides quick
validation while you are writing your build files.

<h2>Run Ant targets from within jEdit.</h2>
There are two ways to run targets from the AntFarm tree.
<p>
Select the target in the tree and click the Run. If a project is
selected the default target will be run.
<p>
Select the target in the tree, right click and select the Run menu item.
<p>
By default, you will be prompted to enter runtime properties to send to
Ant after you run a target. This can be turned off from the property
dialog, or turned back on by unchecking, Global Options -> Plugin
Options -> Ant Farm -> Properties, Do not prompt for properties when
running targets
The next section explains how to run targets from the Console plugin.

<h2>Integration with the Console plugin.</h2>
AntFarm is closely tied to the Console plugin. The Console provides a
convienent way to display streamed output within jEdit. Console also
provides error parsing through a pattern matching scheme that is very
powerful. If you would like to add custom pattern matchers to use with
AntFarm, refer to the Console documentation. Additionally, Console
provides a mechanism for adding custom command interpreters called
shells. AntFarm uses the Ant shell to allow quick command line access to
some of the features of AntFarm.

<h2>Displaying build output.</h2>
When running a target from AntFarm all output will be sent to the
Consoleâ€™s output window. Any errors that match the built-in patterns
will be sent to the ErrorList.
To stop a target while running, use the Stop button on the Console
toolbar.

<h2>The Ant Shell</h2>
You can use the Ant Shell indepentently of the AntFarm tree. The Ant
shell provides the following commands:
<dl>
<dt>! [prop=value]*</dt><dd>  runs the default target for the current build file
with specified properties.</dd>
<p>
<dt>![target_name] [prop=value]*</dt><dd>  runs the specified target for the current
build file with specified properties.</dd>
<p>
<dt>?</dt><dd>  lists the available build files and usage</dd>
<p>
<dt>=build_file_number</dt><dd>  changes the current build file to the number
identified by </dd>
<p>
<dt>+[full_path_to_file]</dt><dd>  load this build file into Ant Farm. Searches up
the current buffers directory tree for a build.xml file to load if a
file is not specified. Re-loads the build file if it is already loaded.</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Access to the Ant build files assets.</h2>
AntFarm provides a couple quick short cuts to the different assests
associated with a build file.
<p>
To edit the underlying build file, right click on the project in the
tree and select the Edit build file item. This will open the build file
in jEdit and allow you to make changes. The tree will be automatically
updated when ever the file is saved.
<p>
To browse the base directory of the project, right click on the project
in the tree and select the Browse project files item. Each Ant project
has a base directory. This command opens that directory in the File
System Browser.

<h2>ProjectViewer Integration</h2>
If the ProjectViewer plugin is also installed, then extra functionality
will be avilable.
<p>
Within the ProjectViewer settings for a particular project, there will
be an Ant settings page, that allows specifying the main ant build file
for your project, and 4 targets to be easily invoked.
<p>
For example, you may want to set Target A to be the build target for
each of your projects, and then you can easily invoke this using the Run
Project Target A action. This will automatically figure out the ant
build script and exact target to invoke based on the project the current
file belongs to.
<p>
If the Emacs Browser plugin is installed, the Select and Run a Project
Target action can also be used. This will provide a list of all the
targets in the build file defined for the current project, so the
required one can be easily invoked.
This functionality is based on that previously available under jedit 4.2
in the AntHelper plugin by Beau Tateyama.
