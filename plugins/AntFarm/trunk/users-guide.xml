<para>
 The <application>AntFarm</application> plugin provides quick access to Ant build files from within jEdit. </para>
 
 <para> This plugin is currently unmaintained. If you would like to help in its maintenance, please post to <email>jedit-devel@lists.sourceforge.net</email> and someone will help you get started. 
 Alan Ezust has patched AntFarm to build/run with current versions of the dependent plugins, but is not addressing some of the existing bugs. He prefers to use the Ant features of Console directly. </para>
 
 <para> AntFarm has five main features:

<para>
 <application>Ant</application> is a Java based make tool developed by the
 <ulink url="http://ant.apache.org">Apache Ant project</ulink>.
</para>
<para>
 For help writing <application>Ant</application> build files, please refer to the
 <application>Ant</application> project's

</para>
<para>
 AntFarm includes version 1.6.5 of <application>Ant</application>.
</para>

<sect1 id="configuration"><title>Configuring Ant Farm</title>
<para>To configure Ant Farm, access <guimenu>Global Options</guimenu> -&gt;
 <guilabel>Plugin Options</guilabel> -&gt; <guilabel>Ant Farm</guilabel> -&gt;
 <guilabel>Build Options</guilabel>.
</para>
 <para>
 Ant Farm can be configured to run builds within the current JVM or outside of
 the current JVM using a shell script. Using the current JVM is faster but
 large build tasks may not have enough memory to execute properly. Also, complex
 Ant scripts that require multiple external resources might not run properly
 from the current JVM.
 </para>
 <para>
 If you experience OutOfMemory exceptions when running builds in the same JVM,
 increase the size of the java heap when running jEdit, or use an external
 script. To increase the heap size, use the <command>-mx&lt;size&gt;m</command>
 java command line option when starting jEdit, where
 &lt;size&gt; indicates the amount of memory to be assigned.
 </para>
 <para>
 When you attempt to run an Ant build without having configured you build
 preferences, you will be prompted to select whether you wish to use the current
 JVM or an external script.
 </para>
 <para>
 If you choose to run Ant builds within the current JVM, additional classpath
 elements can be specified when needed. This allows Ant to locate classes
 required for execution. This is useful when using custom tasks and external
 libraries not loaded by JEdit.
 </para>
 <para>
 To run Ant builds outside of the current JVM, specify the build file you wish
 to use. Default build files for multiple operating systems are included with
 the binary distribution of the
 <ulink url="http://ant.apache.org">Apache Ant project</ulink>.
 </para>
 <para>
 Additionally, you can specify global properties that will be passed to Ant.
 Access <guimenu>Global Options</guimenu> -&gt;
 <guilabel>Plugin Options</guilabel> -&gt; <guilabel>Ant Farm</guilabel> -&gt;
 <guilabel>Properties</guilabel>, and enter the name/value pairs for the
 properties you need. Ant Farm will prompt you for runtime properties each time
 you run a target. To turn this feature off, click <guilabel>Do not prompt for
 properties when running targets</guilabel>. Properties specified at target
 runtime are not added to the global properties list.
 </para>
 <para>
 Ant Farm can automatically load build.xml files from the root of any projects
 you manage via the <application>Project Viewer</application>. To enable this,
 check <guilabel>Load build files from the Project Viewer plugin</guilabel>,
 make sure the Project Viewer is docked so it starts immediately with jEdit and
 restart jEdit. Now, whenever you switch to a project that contains a file named
 build.xml, it will be loaded into Ant Farm.
 </para>
 <para>
 Ant Farm also automatically loads any file named build.xml that is opened for
 editing.
 </para>
 <para>
 When running an Ant target, the name of each task is prepended to the output
 text by default. To avoid this and print output in
 <application>emacs</application> friendly mode, check <guilabel>Produce logging
 information without adornments (Emacs mode)</guilabel>.
 </para>
 <para>
 Ant Farm can save all currently changed buffers whenever you execute a target.
 To turn this feature on, check <guilabel>Save all buffers before running a
 target</guilabel>.
 </para>
</sect1>

</chapter>


<chapter id="structure"><title>View the structure of an <application>Ant</application> build
 file.</title>

<para>
 <guimenu>Plugins</guimenu>&gt;<guisubmenu>AntFarm</guisubmenu>
 displays the AntFarm window. This window is floating by default, but can be
 made to dock into the view in the <guilabel>Docking</guilabel> pane of the
 <guimenuitem>Global Options</guimenuitem> dialog box.
</para>

<para>
 The AntFarm window consists of a toolbar which manages the different
 build files you work with and a tree which displays the structure of the build
 files you have added. The tree displays the name attribute of the <application>
 Ant</application> project, if provided, and all defined targets of the project.
</para>

<para>
 In addition to the toolbar buttons, different functions can be accessed by
 right clicking on each item in the tree.
</para>

<sect1 id="toolbar"><title>The AntFarm tool bar</title>

<para>
 Each button on the toolbar shows a tooltip if the mouse pointer is held over it long enough.
 Here is a description of each button:
</para>

<itemizedlist>
 <listitem><para><guibutton>Add</guibutton> - provides a file chooser dialog box
 which allows you to chose the <application>Ant</application> build file you
 want to work with. Multiple build files can be added to the tree.
</para>
<para>
 The traditional name for an <application>Ant</application> build file is
 "build.xml". In addition to the Add button, AntFarm is setup to automatically load any file named
 "build.xml" into the tree.
 </para>
 <para>
 In addition, AntFarm contains the option to load "build.xml" files from any
 project you may manage using the <application>Project Viewer</application> plugin.
 To activate this feature, check <guimenu>Global Options</guimenu> -&gt;
 <guilabel>Plugin Options</guilabel> -&gt; <guilabel>Ant Farm</guilabel>
 -&gt; <guilabel>Load build files from the Project Viewer plugin</guilabel>.
 </para>
 </listitem>

 <listitem><para><guibutton>Remove</guibutton> - removes the currently selected build
 file from the tree. This does not affect the build file itself in any way.
 </para></listitem>

 <listitem><para><guibutton>Run</guibutton> - runs the current target that is
 selected in the tree. If the currently selected item is a project, AntFarm
 will run the default target for that build file.
 </para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</sect1>

</chapter>

<chapter id="errors"><title>Dynamically parse <application>Ant</application> build files
 and display errors.</title>

<para>
 <application>Ant</application> build files are defined using XML. When a build
 file is added to the AntFarm, it's structure is parsed and the targets are
 displayed in the tree. If an error is encountered while parsing, a message will
 be displayed in the tree and an entry will be sent to the
 <application>ErrorList</application> plugin. The <application>ErrorList</application>
  entry provides quick access to the line that caused the problem in the
  build file when a line number is available.
</para>
<para>
 When changes are made and saved to a build file that is loaded in AntFarm,
 the tree will be reparsed and updated to display the current status of the
 file. Just as in loading, any errors will be caught and displayed via the tree
 and the <application>ErrorList</application>. This feature provides quick
 validation while you are writing your build files.
</para>

</chapter>

<chapter id="run"><title>Run <application>Ant</application> targets from within jEdit.
</title>

 <para>
 There are two ways to run targets from the AntFarm tree.
 <itemizedlist>
  <listitem><para>
  Select the target in the tree and click the <guibutton>Run</guibutton>. If a
  project is selected the default target will be run.
  </para></listitem>
  <listitem><para>
  Select the target in the tree, right click and select the
  <guimenu>Run</guimenu> menu item.
  </para></listitem>
  </itemizedlist></para>
  <para>
  By default, you will be prompted to enter runtime properties to send to Ant
  after you run a target. This can be turned off from the property dialog, or
  turned back on by unchecking, <guimenu>Global Options</guimenu> -&gt;
 <guilabel>Plugin Options</guilabel> -&gt; <guilabel>Ant Farm</guilabel> -&gt;
 <guilabel>Properties</guilabel>, <guilabel>Do not prompt for
 properties when running targets</guilabel>
  </para>
  <para>The next section explains how to run targets from the
  <application>Console</application> plugin.
  </para>
</chapter>

<chapter id="console-integration"><title>Integration with the <application>Console</application> plugin.</title>
 <para>
 AntFarm is closley tied to the <application>Console</application> plugin.
 The <application>Console</application> provides a convienent way to display
 streamed output within jEdit. <application>Console</application> also provides
 error parsing through a pattern matching scheme that is very powerful. If you
 would like to add custom pattern matchers to use with AntFarm, refer to the
 Console documentation. Additionally, <application>Console</application>
 provides a mechanism for adding custom command interpreters called
 <quote>shells</quote>. AntFarm uses the <quote>Ant</quote> shell to allow
 quick command line access to some of the features of AntFarm.
 </para>

 <sect1 id="build-output"><title>Displaying build output.</title>
 <para>
 When running a target from AntFarm all output will be sent to the Console's
 output window. Any errors that match the built-in patterns will be sent to the
 <application>ErrorList</application>.
 </para>
 <para>
 To stop a target while running, use the <guibutton>Stop</guibutton> button on
 the <application>Console</application> toolbar.
 </para>
 </sect1>

 <sect1 id="ant-shell"><title>The Ant Shell</title>
 <para>
 You can use the Ant Shell indepentently of the AntFarm tree.
 The Ant shell provides the following commands:
 </para>
 <itemizedlist>
 <listitem><para>
 <command>! <literal>[prop=value]*</literal></command>	-- runs the default
 target for the current build file with specified properties.
 </para></listitem>
 <listitem><para>
 <command>!<literal>[target_name]</literal> <literal>[prop=value]*</literal>
 </command>		-- runs the specified target for the current build file with
 specified properties.
 </para></listitem>
 <listitem><para>
 <command>?</command>			-- lists the available build files and usage
 </para></listitem>
 <listitem><para>
 <command>=<literal>build_file_number</literal></command>	-- changes the current build file to the number identified by "?"
 </para></listitem>

 <listitem><para>
 <command>+<literal>[full_path_to_file]</literal></command>	-- load this build
 file into Ant Farm. Searches up the current buffer's directory tree for a
 "build.xml" file to load if a file is not specified. Re-loads the build file if it is already loaded.
 </para></listitem>
 </itemizedlist>
 </sect1>
 </chapter>

 <chapter id="asset-access"><title>Access to the <application>Ant</application> build
 file's assets.</title>

 <para>AntFarm provides a couple quick short cuts to the different assests
 associated with a build file.
 </para>

 <itemizedlist>
 <listitem><para>
 To edit the underlying build file, right click on the project in the tree and
 select the <guimenu>Edit build file</guimenu> item. This will open the build
 file in jEdit and allow you to make changes. The tree will be automatically
 updated when ever the file is saved.
 </para>
 </listitem>
 <listitem><para>
 To browse the base directory of the project, right click on the project in the
 tree and select the <guimenu>Browse project files</guimenu> item. Each
 <application>Ant</application> project has a base directory. This command opens
 that directory in the <application>File System Browser</application>.
 </para></listitem>
 </itemizedlist>
