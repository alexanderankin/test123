 <chapter id="intro"> 
  <title> Introduction </title>

 <para> The CtagsInterfacePlugin provides two dockables, a <guilabel>Tag List</guilabel> and a <guilabel>Tag Preview</guilabel>. It also provides a number of operations that allow you to quickly jump from one file location to another in the editor, based on the context of the caret, and the indexed tag information obtained from the <ulink url="http://ctags.sourceforge.net/">Exuberant Ctags</ulink> executable. And finally, it provides a plugin interface through which other jedit plugins can easily access ctags data.
 </para>
 
 <note> <title> About Memory and Database Size </title>
 <para> Because the database can get rather large, depending on how much sourcecode is indexed, this can also mean that jEdit's JVM will require a larger heap size. Be sure to keep that in mind, if you find that jEdit periodically grinds to a halt, or crashes, when CtagsInterface is used - out of heap memory errors can happen in many different places and may exhibit very different behavior depending on where it happens first. You can increase the JVM heap size by editing the script that starts jEdit
 </para>
 
<programlisting>
export JAVA_HEAP_SIZE=750
[...] 
exec "$JAVA_HOME/bin/java" -mx${JAVA_HEAP_SIZE}m  "-Djedit.home=$JEDIT_HOME" 
 "-Dawt.useSystemAAFontSettings=on" "-Dswing.aatext=true"
 ${JEDIT} -jar "$JEDIT_HOME/jedit.jar" -reuseview $@

 <chapter id="tagdbs">
   <title> Tagging Projects and Source Trees </title>
   
   <para> CtagsInterface uses an embedded sql database, hsqldb, to keep track of tag data from multiple projects and directory trees.
   The <guimenuitem>Plugin Options - CtagsInterface</guimenuitem> provides dialogs for adding projects and directory trees that should be indexed.
   </para>
   
   <para> The first step is to add the projects and source trees that you want to be tagged in the database. Tag them in the background, and go back into jEdit. 
   When they are done, you should see no pending I/O requests in the <guimenuitem>Utilities - Troubleshooting - I/O Progress Monitor</guimenuitem>. After your selected projects have been added, you can lookup some tags. </para>
   
   <para> You can add projects two ways. From the ProjectViewer, right click on the project and <guimenuitem>Add Project to Database</guimenuitem>. Or, from <guimenuitem>Plugin Options - CtagsInterface - Projects</guimenuitem>. </para>
   
   <para> Similarly, you can add sourcetrees from the <guimenuitem>plugin options - CtagsInterface - Source Trees</guimenuitem>, or from the file system browser context menu: <guimenuitem>plugins - Add source tree to Tags Database</guimenuitem>. </para> 
   
 </chapter>

 <chapter id="lookup">
   <title> Tag Lookup </title>
   
   <para> By default, tag lookup will search the entire tag database for matching tags, including all added projects and source trees. </para>
   
   <para> When using jEdit with ProjectViewer, you might be working with a set of files, and have to frequently check another set of files that you are reusing. This means that you will probably want to restrict your search to only the projects and source trees that are related to your project. </para> 
   
   
   <para> By editing the properties of the current project, you can see a <guilabel>Dependencies</guilabel> pane, which allows you to set the related projects or source trees on an individual project basis. While running the Tag Preview, or performing a Jump to Tag while working in a project that has dependencies set, CtagsInterface should restrict its searches to tag data from only those projects and directory trees.
   </para>

   <para> This is especially useful in the case where there are many projects / source trees indexed in the tags database that are not related to each other. 
   </para>
   
 </chapter>
 
 <chapter id="actions">
   <title> Actions </title>
   
   <formalpara><title> Add tag File </title>
   <para> Adds an already generated ctags file to the database. </para>
   </formalpara>
   
   <formalpara><title> Tag all projects </title>
   <para> This does exactly what it says: it goes through <emphasis role="bold">every</emphasis> project that ProjectViewer knows about, and tags their files, adding the tag data to the embedded database. 
   </para>
   </formalpara>
   
   <section id="dynamic-actions">
   <title> Dynamic Actions </title>
   
   
   <para> In addition to these built-in actions, CtagsInterface allows you to create dynamic Actions, which are custom SQL queries, which can be bound to keyboard shortcuts.
   </para>
   
   <para> TODO: add stuff about dynamic actions here. </para>
   
   </section>
   
 </chapter>
 
 <chapter id="dockables">
   <title> CtagsInterface Dockables </title>
   
   <para> There are two dockables that you can use from CtagsInterface. </para>
   
   <formalpara> <title> Tag List </title>
   <para> When <action>jump to tag</action> is invoked, if there is more than one possible match, the Tag List dockable is displayed, where you can preview and select the choices of jump locations. </para>
   
   </formalpara>
   <formalpara> <title> Tag Preview </title>
   <para> This dockable is updated automatically (after a configurable delay) whenever the caret is moved over a location that is a known symbol in the tag database. 
   </para>
   
   </formalpara>
   
 </chapter>
   
 <chapter id="pluginservices">
   <title> Services to other plugins </title>
   <para> CtagsInterface also offers services to other plugins: ClassBrowser, and Tags: </para>
   
   <orderedlist>
   <listitem><para> Queries of the tags database </para></listitem>
   <listitem><para> Jumping to tags. </para></listitem>
   </orderedlist>

   <para> Since the CtagsInterface manages the tags information and runs ctags, this means that other plugins do not need to call/depend on ctags directly. This also means that in the future, the CtagsInterface may be extended to work with other code-indexing tools. </para>
