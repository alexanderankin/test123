Changes:

Version 1.1:
- 2009-10-20: Better integration with Navigator - when jumping to a tag in
  another buffer, prevent Navigator from recording the initial buffer position
  (either the beginning of the buffer or the position when the buffer was last
  closed), so it only records the positions before and after the jump.
  Navigator is now an optional dependency of CtagsInterface.
- 2009-09-30: Prevent adding the same origin record twice to the ORIGINS table.
- 2009-09-03: Fixed NPEs when the project listener provides null lists for
  added/removed files.
- 2009-08-23: Fixed bug ##2843099 - NPE from the plugin's stop() method.
- 2009-08-19: Fixes for including plugin documentation in jEdit help.
- 2009-08-03: Tag completion: Allowing added characters to filter out the
  completion tags, and backspace to extend the completion tags up to the
  original prefix.
- 2009-07-31: Do not cause ProjectViewer to be loaded due to checking the type
  of edit bus messages. Loading PV while checking the edit bus message causes a
  ClassCircularityError because JARClassLoader activates the plugin, and during
  activation PV sends another edit bus message.
- 2009-07-31: Fixed bug #2828947: NPE on clean setup.
- 2009-07-30: Tag list dockable: After filtering the tag list, if a single tag
  remains, jump to it directly.
