To do:
- Allow files to be shared by several origins. This means:
  + Multiple origins in the tag doctype documents.
    Can be either multiple fields with the same name, or one single field with
    a concatenated string of origins.
  + Tag parser - before deleting all tags of a file from the index, find the
    origins to which the file belongs, to save for later.
    Later, when inserting the new tags of the file, use all the origins it
    previously had.
  --> Deleting an origin: Search all tags with that origin. Check the number
    of origins - delete the document if it's 1, otherwise just remove the
    origin being deleted. This might mean removing all origin fields, and
    adding back all of them except for the one being deleted.
  - Insertion always comes 
- Option for case-insensitive tag name DB queries. (also for the preview pane) 
- Option to include dependencies in active project tag searches.
- Easy way to add project dependencies to tag db.
- Handle long delay before background tagging begins for source trees or projects.
- Handle long delay during startup because of hsqldb.
/ Finish project listener - handle project renames etc.
  Cannot be done easily with the current PV interface.
--> Design plugin support. 
- User guide.

Done:
+ Switch from using a relational database to Lucene.
+ Add project dependency properties. (To be integrated into PV later)
+ An action to add all existing projects to the DB.
+ An option to track project creation/removal and update the DB.
+ When jumping to a tag, verify that the line exists. The tag DB may be outdated.
+ Handle case when there is no active project when tag search is limited to active project.
  (e.g. group of projects is selected instead of an active project)
+ Preview dockable:
  + Support for multiple text areas (split edit pane)
  + Move tag query + file loading to worker thread
+ Context menu items to project viewer to add/remove the selected project.
+ Create an auto-preview dockable for definitions of the identifier under caret.
  Handle multiple definitions as a list in that dockable.
+ Project support:
  + Option pane in the plugin to define "watched" projects.
  + Monitor watched projects for changes (add/remove files) and auto-update DB.
  + Update DB when files belonging to a watched project are saved/loaded.
  + Option to limit searches to active project.
  + Actions option pane: SQL query "Jump to tag" actions.
  + Change column names to A_<attribute name>. Some attributes are also
    reserved words in SQL and cannot be used as column names (e.g. union).
  + Redesign DB tables.
  + Option to limit tag searches to active project.
+ Auto-update DB when:
  + Watched buffer is saved
  + Watched buffer is loaded
  + Files are added to / removed from watched projects.
+ Add project name or id to each tag in the table.
+ Update to released PV: tags/pv_2_1_3_7
