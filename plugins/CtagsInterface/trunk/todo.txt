- Decide on the functionality of the plugin:
  - What kind of project support to provide?
    Clearly, need to know for each tag which project it belongs to.
    Either add a project column, or different tables for different projects.
    Project support means:
    1. Option pane in the plugin to define "watched" projects.
    2. A watched project is monitored for changes (add/remove file) and the DB updated
       accordingly.
    3. Files belonging to a watched project are monitored for changes inside jEdit.
    4. Project dependency: Currently will be defined by CtagsInterface, later integrated
       into PV.
    5. Option whether a watched project causes dependency projects to be watched.
