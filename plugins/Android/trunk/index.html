Version 1.1
<p>
The Android plugin helps you create and run AVDs (Android Virtual Device), and create Android projects 
and import them into ProjectViewer.
<p>
Prerequisites:
<ul>
<li>Android development kit is installed.</li>
<li>Android development kit tools are in your system path or specified in the plugin option settings.</li>
<li>Ant 1.8 or later is installed and in your system path or specified in the plugin option settings.</li>
</ul>
Until these are installed, some or all of this plugin will not work.
<p>
Available actions:
<br>
<ul>

<li><b>Create AVD</b> Creates a new Android Virtual Device. You may select any of the currently
existing Android platform targets provided by your Android development kit 
along with any of the skins supported by the selected platform target.</li>

<li><b>Create Project</b> Creates a new Android project. This creates a skeleton
Android project at the location you specify. The "Build target" is the
minimum Android platform target that your app will run on. The "activity" is
the main Android activity class in your project. A class with this name will
be created and your apk file will also have this name. After the project is
created, you will be asked if you want to add this project to ProjectViewer.</li>

<li><b>Launch AVD</b> Select any existing AVD and start it.</li>

<li><b>Launch Debug Monitor</b> Starts the Debug Monitor, which
is useful in debugging Android apps running in an emulator. Depending on your
sdk version, this will launch either the Dalvic Debug Monitor or the Android
Device Monitor. </li>

<li><b>Build App (Debug)</b> Build the debug version of your app. Output is to 
Console. The <code>debug</code> target in the <code>build.xml</code> file in 
the base directory of the current ProjectViewer project is executed.</li>

<li><b>Deploy App (Debug)</b> Deploy the debug version of your app to a currently
running emulator. Output is to Console. The <code>installd</code> target in the 
<code>build.xml</code> file in the base directory of the current ProjectViewer 
project is executed.</li>
