<h1>Spell Check jEdit plugin release 4</h1>

This is a jEdit plugin to perform spell checking of text in a jEdit buffer.
It is based on <a href="http://aspell.sourceforge.net/">Aspell</a>
(which you may need to download and install before using this plugin) which is
available for Windows and various Unix platforms.


<h2>Features</h2>

<ul>
  <li>An jEdit action to spell check selected text or entire buffer if
    no selection.</li>
  <li>An jEdit action to spell check selected text or entire buffer if
    no selection using an alternate lang dictionary.</li>
  <li>Configurable location of <a href="http://aspell.sourceforge.net/">Aspell</a>
    executable.</li>
  <li>Configurable main language dictionary (requires the correct installation
    of the corresponding language for Aspell).</li>
  <li>Automatically (or manually) discards tags for all defined markup edit modes
    likes html, xml, ...</li>
  <li>Spell check dialog to allow the user to validate each suspect word. The
    dialog has buttons for: Cancel, Change, Change All, Ignore, and Ignore All.
    It shows the suspect word, lists suggested replacements, and has a field
    where the user can type in the replacement word.</li>
</ul>


<h2>System Requirements</h2>

<ul>
  <li>The plugin requires jEdit 4.0 or later.</li>
  <li>The plugin requires Java JDK 1.3 --for no real reason (bummer).</li>
  <li>Tested on Windows 2000, XP and Linux.</li>
  <li>Aspell .32.6 alpha or better (I am using Aspell .33.5 alpha).</li>
</ul>


<h2>Installation and Configuration</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Download and install <a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/aspell/aspell-.33.5-win32-i386.zip">aspell-.33.5-win32-i386.zip</a>
    for Windows. If you are running some flavor of Unix, you can get the source
    as well as some binaries from <a href="http://aspell.sourceforge.net/">Aspell</a> (note that Aspell
    is generally installed by default on Linux and is in the path).</li>
  <li>Copy the the <code>SpellCheck.jar</code> file to your jEdit <code>jars</code>
    directory.</li>
  <li>Restart jEdit. You should see a <code>Spell Check</code> entry on the <code>Plugins</code>
    menu.</li>
  <li>In the <code>Utilities/Global Options.../Plugin Options/Spell Check</code>
    option dialog set the <code>Aspell executable filename</code> to where you have
    installed it or leave the default if any. You can also specify here a different
    language dictionary or choose in the dictionary list (correct Aspell executable
    path must be correctly set for that). You can also choose to let markup mode be
    set automatically or not and add any extra Aspell command line arguments (type
    Aspell --help in a console to know what they are).</li>
</ul>


<h2>Usage</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Select the text you would like to spell check (no selection will spell check all the buffer).</li>
  <li>Choose the menu item <code>Plugins/Spell check/Spell check selection...</code>
    for default lang dictionary or <code>Plugins/Spell check/Spell check selection with lang...</code>
    to use an alternate lang dictionary.</li>
  <li>The Aspell subprocess will start. (On Windows for JDK older than 1.4.0 a DOS
    console is displayed and may hide the Spell Check validation dialog).</li>
  <li>You will be prompted with a MS-Office-like spell check dialog box for each
    word that needs to be validated.</li>
  <li>Below is more info on the dialog box.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Spell Check Dialog Box</h3>

<p>For each misspelled word the user has buttons to choose to:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Add (not in this version)</dt>
  <dd>Adds the word not in the <cite> Not in Dictionary</cite> field to the dictionary.</dd>
  <dt>Cancel</dt> HystoryTextField
  <dd>Closes the dialog box without making any changes you have made.</dd>
  <dt>Change</dt>
  <dd>Replaces the word not in the <cite> Not in Dictionary</cite> text field with the word in the
    <cite> Change to</cite>  text field. If the <cite> Change to</cite> text field is empty,
    the button name changes to <cite>Delete</cite>. To remove the selected word from the item, click
    <cite>Delete</cite>.</dd>
  <dt>Change All</dt>
  <dd>Replaces all instances of the word not in the <cite> Not in Dictionary</cite>
    text field with the word in the
    <cite> Change to</cite>  text field. If the <cite> Change to</cite> text field is empty,
    the button name changes to <cite>Delete All</cite>. To remove all instances of the selected word from the item, click
    <cite>Delete</cite>.</dd>
  <dt>Ignore</dt>
  <dd>Leaves the word not in the <cite> Not in Dictionary</cite> text field unchanged.</dd>
  <dt>Ignore All</dt>
  <dd>Leaves all instances of the word not in the <cite> Not in Dictionary</cite>
    text field unchanged.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The dialog has the following components:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Not in Dictionary:</dt>
  <dd>Displays a possible error, such as a misspelled word, a duplicate word, or a incorrect capitalization.</dd>
  <dt>Change to:</dt>
  <dd>Displays a suggested word to replace the word that appears in the <cite> Not in Dictionary</cite>
    text field. To accept the suggested replacement, click <cite>Change</cite>. To delete the word in the
    <cite> Not in Dictionary</cite> text field, delete the text in the <cite> Change to</cite>
    text field, and then click <cite>Delete</cite>.</dd>
  <dt>Suggestions:</dt>
  <dd>Lists suggested replacement words.</dd>
</dl>


<h2>Building</h2>
<p>
I do the build using
<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/index.html">Ant</a>. Look in the
<code>build.cmd</code> file for the version of Ant used. To see the build targets,
type <code>build -project help</code>. The most important target is
<code>make.jar.spellPlugin</code> which creates the
<code>SpellPlugin.jar</code>. There are other targets, but the <code>build.xml</code>
is still a bit full of crap.
</p>
<p>Mike Dillon contributed
a <code>makefile.jmk</code> makefile, which should work, but I have not used,
but should make some people happy.
</p>


<h2>Current Bugs</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
  The Aspell subprocess creates a visible console window on Windows
  95/98/NT/2000.
  The console window is a long-standing Java
  <a href="http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/bugParade/bugs/4244515.html">bug</a>..
  Sun encountered problems under Windows 95 and 98 when the JVM ran system calls in a
  hidden window, which are still there under Windows NT/2000.
  <br>
  If you kill the visible console window, when you next spell check you will get
  an error. If you spell check again, it should work as the subprocess is
  recreated.
  <br>
  Fixed with JDK 1.4.
  </li>

</ul>


<h2>Current Todo List</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Add words to an user dictionary</li>
  <li>Allow the user to reset Ignore All and Change All options (currently these
    are result only if jEdit is restarted)</li>
  <li>Undo a change</li>
  <li>Allow the user access all of Aspell options</li>
  <li>Complete tool tips on the Validation dialog</li>
  <li>Use the EditBus to report spelling errors (so they can be underlined like
    Word does)</li>
  <li>Highlight the context of the word being corrected</li>
</ul>


<h2>Change Log</h2>

<h3>Release 004 (Jul 25, 2002) - <a href="mailto:lio-sand@ifrance.com">L.Fiol</a></h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Fix: the current buffer is no more changed when there were no spell
      errors corrected in the buffer. Instead a status message tells there
      were nothing to correct.</li>
    <li>Fix: the last line separator of the selection which is spell
      checked is removed if any.</li>
    <li>Fix: Exception was thrown when there was no suggestion for a word.</li>
    <li>Updated for jEdit 4.0 API.</li>
    <li>Spell checks for entire buffer when no selection.</li>
    <li>If the Aspell executable field is empty it is defaulted to 'Aspell'
      on Unix systems. On others systems an open file dialog is displayed.
      The Aspell executable property is saved afterward.</li>
    <li>Add the ability to choose another language dictionary than the default
      one (use both the --lang and --language-tag parameters as some systems
      seems to need the first and others the second).</li>
    <li>Add the ability to choose to automatically discard tags in all defined
      markup edit modes.</li>
    <li>Add the ability to specify any additional Aspell parameter.</li>
  </ul>

<h3>Release 003 (Sep 09, 2001)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Same functionality as R002, but now in SourceForge's CVS.</li>
    <li>Cleaned and improved the build.xml and build.cmd files.</li>
  </ul>

<h3>Release 002 (Apr 22, 2001)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Added build files (<code>build.xml</code> and <code>makefile.jmk</code>)
    to distribution</li>
  <li>Updated <code>help.html</code> with test feedback and system requirements</li>
  <li>The <code>ValidationDialog</code> now remembers its last placement. This
    means that once you move it out-of-the-way, it stays out-of-the-way.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Release 001 (Apr 16, 2001)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>First release.</li>
  </ul>
