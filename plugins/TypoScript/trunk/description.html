    <P>The TypoScript plugin provides virtual filesystem support for loading and editing the "setup" and "constants" templates within the TYPO3 CMS, complete with a contributed edit mode allowing syntax highlighting. It interfaces with TYPO3 using XML-RPC, so you will need to install the jeditvfs extension in the TYPO3 backend (available from TER via the Extension Manager). A site browser dockable panel is included as a means for locating the template to load. Templates cannot be created from within jEdit; you must first create them in the backend as usual.</P>
