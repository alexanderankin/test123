Slime embeds a REPL (Read Eval Print Loop) shell into Console that allows
you to have a REPL session running at all times. Actions are provided for
evaluating code within the running REPL session; you can evaluate selected
text, the active buffer, or choose an external file.

This version supports running REPL's for Clojure, Groovy, and Python.
