 Slime is a jEdit plugin influenced by SLIME (Superior Lisp Interaction Mode
 for Emacs). It provides a shell in Console that allows you to have an
 interactive REPL session (Read Eval Print Loop) running at all times, with
 actions to evaluate inside it the currently-selected text, the active buffer,
 or an external file.
 </para>
 <para>
 This version of Slime comes with support for Clojure, Groovy, and Python.

 <sect1 id="clojure"><title>Clojure</title>
  To use the Clojure REPL, you need one of two things:
  <itemizedlist>
   <listitem>
    An executable with the name "clojure" on your system path (Windows batch
    files should have the .bat extension)
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    An environment variable named "CLOJURE_DIR" whose value is the directory
    that the clojure jar is in (which should be named simply "clojure.jar")
   </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>
 </sect1>
 <sect1 id="groovy"><title>Groovy</title>
  To use the Groovy REPL, you need one of two things:
  <itemizedlist>
   <listitem>
    The "bin" subfolder of groovy's home on your system path (typing "groovysh"
    into a terminal or command prompt should bring up the REPL).
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    An environment variable named "GROOVY_HOME" that points to groovy"s home
    folder.
   </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>
 </sect1>
 <sect1 id="python"><title>Python</title>
  To use the Python REPL, you must have the python executable somewhere on your
  system path.
