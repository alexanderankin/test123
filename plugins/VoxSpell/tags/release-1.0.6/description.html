<p>The VoxSpell plugin checks the spelling of English language documents
(more languages may be supported in the future, contact the author if you're
willing to help). It comes bundled with an English language dictionary produced
from the SCOWL word list hosted at (<a
href="http://wordlist.sourceforge.net/">Kevin's Word List Page</a>).</p>

<p>Warning: the algorithm used to store the word suggestion list is unoptimized.
This plugin consumes, typically, ~30MB of memory</p>
