    <h1>VoxSpell</h1>
    
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    
        <p>The VoxSpell plugin checks the spelling of English language
        documents (more languages may be supported in the future, contact the
        author if you're willing to help). It comes bundled with an English
        language dictionary produced from the SCOWL word list hosted at <a
        href="http://wordlist.sourceforge.net/">Kevin's Word List Page</a>.</p>
        
        <p>Warning: the algorithm used to store the word suggestion list is
        unoptimized. This plugin consumes, typically, ~30MB of memory</p>
                
    <h2>Usage</h2>
    
        <p>Running the voxspellcheck.start action starts spell checking in the
        active EditPane. Running the voxspellcheck.stop action stops spell checking
        in the active EditPane.</p>
        
        <p>The spell checker supports ignoring words. The list of ignored words
        is reset when jEdit quits (or the plugin in unloaded). The ignored list
        can also be reset by the voxspellcheck.reset action.</p>
        
        <p>Words can be added to a user dictionary through the
        voxspellcheck.addWord action. The user dictionary is stored in the jEdit
        settings directory and is named "user_dict".</p>
        
        <p>Suggestions for misspelled words can be activated by the
        voxspellcheck.suggest action.</p>
        
        <p>Any of the above actions can be bound to keyboard shortcuts through
        the jEdit shortcuts settings pane.</p>
        
    <h2>Options</h2>
    
        <p>3 modes are supported by the spell checker:
            <ol>
                <li>All text, where all text in a document is checked.
                <li>Non markup, where text that isn't syntax highlighted is
                checked.
                <li>Literal or comment, where only words highlighted as literal
                or comment are checked.
            </ol>
        </p>
        
        <p>The types of files which correspond to each mode can be set in the
        VoxSpell plugin option pane. The lists are space separated buffer edit
        mode names. The default mode is "literal or comment."</p>
