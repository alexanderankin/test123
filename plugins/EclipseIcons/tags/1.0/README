To build from svn checkout, just run the build.xml file with Ant.

To build from scratch, run these in order:

1. imageCopy.xml:

The imageCopy file is an Ant build file.  It copies all the Eclipse icons from
a local Eclipse installation to the src/icons directory.  It copies all .png,
.gif, and .jpg files without regard to size.  It will overwrite existing files.
It does not delete any files.


2. imageCopy.props:

This property file is used by imageCopy.xml to determine the location of the
local Eclipse installation.  This should be changed per installation.


3. deleteLargeIcons.bsh:

This macro deletes all icons from the src/icons directory that have a dimension 
larger than 16 pixels.  Run this from jEdit by choosing it from Macros -

4. createImageHtml.bsh:

This macro creates an html page named "icons.html" to display all the Eclipse icons
found in the src/icons folder and puts the "icons.html" file into the docs
folder.  This macro replaces any previously existing "icons.html" file.  Run
this from jEdit by choosing it from Macros - Run Other Macro...


5. build.xml:
