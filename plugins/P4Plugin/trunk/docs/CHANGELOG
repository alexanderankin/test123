CHANGELOG

Version 0.2.3:
	[marcelo vanzin]
	- now requires Java 1.5.
	- fix weird NPE when handling an EditBus message.
	- add a "diff" action and related configuration to set what diff
	  tool to use.
	- make the file info actions asynchronous.
	- properly set up the user environment when running the P4 binary;
	  this allows wrapper scripts around p4 (that might rely on
	  environment variables) to be used.
	- add support for P4CONFIG instead of P4CLIENT.

Version 0.2.2:
	[marcelo vanzin]
	- fix NPE in P4FileMenu.java.
	- use reflection to call Console.setShell(), since the method is
	  binary-incompatible between Console versions 4.2 and 4.3.
	- need to check the key interceptor registrating when getting
	  and EditPaneUpdate message also.
	- don't store the configuration as a serialized object; just use
      regular properties to avoid problems with class loaders.

Version 0.2.1:
	[marcelo vanzin]
	- set the serialVersionUID field for class P4Config to avoid
	  serialization problems.
	- fix possible deadlock in P4Change.java (same fix as was already
	  there in AsynP4Action.java)
	- fix NPE in P4Shell.java when console wasn't yet active.
	- keep list of child actions in P4FileMenu.java so we can set
	  their viewer instance.
	- reworked a lot of the threading code; should be less prone to
	  deadlocks. Also, make use of new code added to CommonControls.
	- install perforce mode file.
	- file filters now correctly ignores files with head action "delete"
	- add "filelog" action (and make code in P4Stat.java more generic)

Version 0.2.0:
	[marcelo vanzin]
	- initial release to plugin central.
