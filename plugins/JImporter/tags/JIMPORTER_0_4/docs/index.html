    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    JImporter is a plugin for JEdit that will generate import statements at the
    top of a Java Class given the (non-fully qualified) name of a class.  It does
    this by searching through a classpath that you specify through the JImporter
    options.  JImporter includes options to group imports into your favorite
    categories and to sort them in the way that you prefer.<br>

    <a name="classpath"></a>
    <h2>Classpath Options</h2>
    The classpath that is searched can come from a variety of sources.  You 
    choose which source you'd like to use through the configuration page of 
    JImporter, a screenshot of which is shown below.<br>
    <br>
    <img src="ClasspathDialog.png"><br>
    <i>The Classpath option pane allows you to choose where jEdit will find your classpath</i><br>
    <br>
    <h3>Use this Classpath</h3>
    Use the classpath that is indicated in the textbox.  The classpath should
    be in the same format you'd expect in an environment variable in your 
    operating system.  For example, if you are in Windows, your classpath should
    be delimited with semicolons.  In unix, the classpath should be delimited 
    with colons.
    
    <h3>Use SpeedJava's classpath</h3>
    Use the classpath that was specified for the SpeedJava plugin.  This 
    prevents you from having to specify your classpath in (yet another) place.
    
    <h3>Use JCompiler's classpath</h3>
    Use the classpath that was specified for the JCompiler plugin.  This 
    prevents you from having to specify your classpath in (yet another) place.
    
    <h3>Use System classpath</h3>
    Use the classpath that was specified when you started JEdit.
    
    <h3>Automatically Search JDK Classes</h3>
    When this option is selected, JImporter will append the location of the rt.jar
    library to your classpath automatically.  This is useful because newer JDK's
    no longer require the location of this jar to be in the classpath.

    <h2>Sorting and Grouping Options</h2>
    JImporter allows you to sort your imports, either automatically when you 
    import a file, or by choosing the "Sort Imports" action from the JImporter
    menu.  This sorting allows you to keep your import statements "tidy."<br>
    <br>
    Sorting often isn't as easy as alphabetically arranging imports though.  Some
    users would like to have case sensitive sorting, others do not.  Another 
    category of users like to have certain import statements appear above others,
    even though they aren't alphabetically supposed to be ordered in that way.<br>
    <br>
    For these reasons, JImporter attempts to allow a lot of configurability.  It 
    is possible to group your imports according to package, or pattern.<br>
    <br>
    <img src="SortingPaneScreenshot.png"><br>
    <i>The sorting and grouping pane</i><br>
    <br>
    The sorting pane also gives you the options.  "Sort Imports on Every Import"
    will sort all of your import statements every time you create an import
    statement using JImporter.  "Uppercase letters are equal to lowercase for
    sorting" satisfies those who consider uppercase letters to be higher in the
    alphabetic sorting order than lowercase letters.<br>
    <br>
    <a name="otheroptions"></a>
    <h2>Miscellaneous options</h2>
    JImporter provides configurability so it can try to make at least some of its
    users happy.  Here are some other miscellaneous options that you might be 
    interested in:
    
    <h3>Automatically Search When Importing at Point</h3>
    If you have bound a key to "Import Class at Point" and if you have a fast 
    machine, this can be a good option for you.  Effectively, this option 
    automatically clicks on the "Search" button to save you time.  You must have
    this option selected if you want to automatically import classes when only
    one exists.<br>
    <br>
    <h3>Automatically Import when only 1 Match Exists</h3>
    The name says it all.  If there is only one match when you do an import at 
    point, automatically generate that import without showing the dialog box.<br>
    <br>
    <h3>Searching Method</h3>
    This is the method that JImporter will use to find the package name of any
    classes that you decide to import.  In the early versions of JImporter, I've
    decided to stick with the brute-force method of searching.  This method will
    iterate through all of the directories and jar files in your classpath to 
    search for matching classes. <br>
    <br>
    Initially, this sounded really awful, as I was concerned that performance 
    would be abysmal.  However, I found out that modern operating systems do a 
    reasonably good job at caching their filesystem entries.  While the first 
    search is pretty slow, subsequent searches aren't.<br>
    <br>
    I fully intend to replace this searching method, eventually.  It isn't that
    I don't know how to use Hashmaps, it just turns out that the problem is 
    slightly more complicated than that to solve.  I have a big list of things 
    I keep in the <a href="todo.txt">Todo List</a> to keep me busy and this one
    hasn't bubbled up far enough to get fixed.  I will do it eventually though.
    (If someone donates code, I won't turn it away though.)

    <h2>Keyboarding Issues and Solutions</h2>
    There are currently some keyboarding interface issues in JImporter from my 
    startpoint.  In my perfect world, this would be how everything would work:<br>
    <br>
    1. You put your cursor on a class and press a key combination to import the
    class at the point.  (I use CS-i as my shortcut.)<br>  
    2. The import dialog box would come up.  As you type in the name of the 
    class, the field of classes would quickly narrow and be shown in the dialog
    box. <br>
    3. Once you had a reasonable number of classes left in your box, you'd 
    use your up and down arrows to select a class and hit enter.<br>
    <br>
    Boy, I wish that were the case.  The problem is that my current "brute force"
    method of searching is just a bit too slow to keep up with this.  Every
    character that you type will take a few seconds to generate a matching 
    result set.  For the meantime, here is how it works:<br>
    <br>
    1. You put your cursor on a class and press a key combination to import the
    class at the point.<br>  
    2. The import dialog box would come up.  Press enter to search for the 
    class your cursor was on, or type a new name and press enter.<br>
    3. A list of matching classes comes up.  Use the up and down arrows.  When 
    you find one you like, press Alt-I to import.<br>
    <br>
    I'll probably always keep the brute force method around though.  It just 
    doesn't take a lot of memory, which makes me happy.<br>

    <h3>Bugs or feature requests</h3>
    If you find a bug, please report it on the JEdit project on sourceforge.  
    Feature requests should be sent directly to my email address.  It might not
    be a bad idea to CC the JEdit mailing list too.

    I welcome all contribution of code!  
    <br>
    If you would like to contribute code to JImporter, please send any patches
    in unified diff format to <a href="mailto:MattFlower@yahoo.com">my email address.</a>
    If you don't know how to do unified diff format, talk to me and we'll figure
    something out.<br>
    <br>
    Please try to comment your code and use good variable naming conventions.  Any
    code that you submit is subject to frequent refactoring and commenting, which
    I enjoy doing.<br>
