BUGS

If you have a bug fix that you'd like to donate, please send it in unified diff
format to MattFlower@yahoo.com.  Please include a bug id from the jedit bug list
if there is one.  If there isn't, please include a detailed description of what
you are fixing.

If you are submitting more than a line or two, please remember to comment your
code.  I've always been kind of a stickler about tidy code.
