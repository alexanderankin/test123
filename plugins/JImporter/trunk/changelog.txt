Changelog for JImporter

0.4.0
* Implemented the "Sort Imports" menu option.  
* Added option which will determine if the sorting algorithm cares about character
case.
* Added option to sort all import statements any time a class is imported.
* Before a class is imported, check to make sure the class isn't already in the
import list.  If it is, tell the user in the status line.  
* Did some internal cleanup of how option checkboxes are created.  (The code was
remarkably inelegant before, it is almost palatable now.)
* Code is now hosted in the JEdit CVS repository on Sourceforge.

0.3.2 - Announced as beta on JEdit-Users list
* Add an option to "Automatically Search when importing class at point" to save
users a few keystrokes.  (Thanks Ken Wootton)
* Show "<Classname> has been imported" in the status bar after you do an import.
* When you selection list comes up, automatically highlight and set focus on the
first item in the list.  This allows you to press enter a second time to do an 
import.  (Little bit of everyone deserves credit for this one.)
* Add option to automatically include rt.jar in the search path.  (Thanks to 
Jigar Patel for the suggestion.)
* Added option to "Automatically Import if Only One Match Exists".  The dialog
box won't even show up if you use this option.  (Thanks to Ken Wootton for the
idea.)
* An exception was raised if you "Imported class at point" on a line that did not
have any text on it.  (Fixed)
* Added a link to the change log from the help screen.

0.3.1 - Unannounced bug fix release
* Added TODO.txt into the jar - it couldn't be accessed from help because it 
wasn't being copied into the jar file.
* Removed the buffered method as an available search method -- it was only there
because I was testing it, it wasn't ready for prime time.

0.3 - Bug fix release (Beta release only)
* Moved around some classes into packages to prepare for growth stemming from the
addition of new features.
* Fix compatibility problem with JEdit 4.0 (My thanks to Jigar Patel for the bug 
report)

0.2 - Internal release (Announced as beta to jedit-users list)
* Implemented architecture to allow the search method to be changed through options.
* Implemented options dialog from within the menuing system.
* Wrote help file to accompany the plugin.
* Lots of bug fixes.
* Added the concept of a "SearchMethod" so we can add more methods of finding files.
* Restructured Classpath.java and SearchMethod.java to be better enumerated classes.
* Made the ESCAPE key close down the JImporter dialog box if you decide you don't
  want to do an import.
  
0.1 - Internal release
* Implemented "Brute Force" algorithm for searching for fully-qualified classes.
* Integrated with JCompiler and SpeedJava's classpath to determine what classpath
  we should be searching.
