    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    JImporter is a plugin for JEdit that will generate import statements at the
    top of a Java Class given the (non-fully qualified) name of a class.<br>
    
    <a name="classpath"></a>
    <h2>Classpath</h2>
    The classpath that is searched can come from a variety of sources.  You 
    choose which source you'd like to use through the configuration page of 
    JImporter, a screenshot of which is shown below.
    
    <h3>Use this Classpath</h3>
    Use the classpath that is indicated in the textbox.  The classpath should
    be in the same format you'd expect in an environment variable in your 
    operating system.  For example, if you are in Windows, your classpath should
    be delimited with semicolons.  In unix, the classpath should be delimited 
    with colons.
    
    <h3>Use SpeedJava's classpath</h3>
    Use the classpath that was specified for the SpeedJava plugin.  This 
    prevents you from having to specify your classpath in (yet another) place.
    
    <h3>Use JCompiler's classpath</h3>
    Use the classpath that was specified for the JCompiler plugin.  This 
    prevents you from having to specify your classpath in (yet another) place.
    
    <h3>Use System classpath</h3>
    Use the classpath that was specified when you started JEdit.

    <h2>Searching Method</h2>
    In this initial release of JImporter, I've only implemented a brute-force 
    method of searching the classpath for a class to import.  Right now, when 
    you search for a class, each directory and JAR file will be traversed to 
    find the class file.<br>
    <br>
    The first time you search for a class name, there will be a pause as your
    operating system starts to cache the directory entries and jar files.  On
    windows, only the first time will be slow.  My classpath is rather large, 
    and it takes JImporter roughly 4 seconds to find the first class (on a 
    mobile Pentium IV 1.7).  Subsequent searches take less than a second.<br>
    <br>
    This method is satisfactory at best.  The problem with this method is that
    I cannot narrow down the choices as the user types in the class name.  This
    makes the import slightly less user friendly than I'd hope.  I hope to have
    this resolved with a release of JImporter sometime soon.  In case you are 
    wondering -- yes, I do know about things like HashMaps.  I am trying to 
    avoid using lots of memory to solve this problem.

    <h2>Keyboarding Issues and Solutions</h2>
    There are currently some keyboarding interface issues in JImporter from my 
    startpoint.  In my perfect world, this would be how everything would work:<br>
    <br>
    1. You put your cursor on a class and press a key combination to import the
    class at the point.  (I use CS-i as my shortcut.)<br>  
    2. The import dialog box would come up.  As you type in the name of the 
    class, the field of classes would quickly narrow and be shown in the dialog
    box. <br>
    3. Once you had a reasonable number of classes left in your box, you'd 
    use your up and down arrows to select a class and hit enter.<br>
    <br>
    Boy, I wish that were the case.  The problem is that my current "brute force"
    method of searching is just a bit too slow to keep up with this.  Every
    character that you type will take a few seconds to generate a matching 
    result set.  For the meantime, here is how it works:<br>
    <br>
    1. You put your cursor on a class and press a key combination to import the
    class at the point.<br>  
    2. The import dialog box would come up.  Press enter to search for the 
    class your cursor was on, or type a new name and press enter.<br>
    3. A list of matching classes comes up.  Use the up and down arrows.  When 
    you find one you like, press Alt-I to import.<br>
    <br>
    I'll probably always keep the brute force method around though.  It just 
    doesn't take a lot of memory, which makes me happy.<br>

    <h3>Bugs or feature requests</h3>
    If you find a bug, please report it on the JEdit project on sourceforge.  
    Feature requests should be sent directly to my email address.  It might not
    be a bad idea to CC the JEdit mailing list too.
    
    <h3>Code contributions</h3>
    I welcome all contribution of code!

    If you would like to contribute code to JImporter, please send any patches
    in unified diff format to <a href="mailto:MattFlower@yahoo.com">my email address.</a><br>
    <br>
    I will warn you in advance that I am a stickler for good commenting.  If 
    your code is not well commented and written, there is a fair chance that I'll 
    ask you to resubmit your patch with the appropriate comments.<br>
