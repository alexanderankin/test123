<H2>Outline plugin</H2>

<p> Provides a SideKick parser service which displays folds rather than language specific structures. </p>

<p> You can switch between "outline" and other parsers from the SideKick parser combo box. </p>

<p>
Outline will work equally well using sidekick or explicit folding mode. They should be the same. 
</p>

<p> Outline will work with other editing modes as well, although it requires that the {{{ fold symbols }}} are inside proper comments for the language of that editing mode. </p>

<p>See the <a href="http://community.jedit.org/cgi-bin/TWiki/view/Plugins/OutlinePlugin">Wiki page</a> for more info.</p>
<p>Bugs and feature requests can be submitted at <a href="http://community.jedit.org/?q=project/Outline">http://community.jedit.org/?q=project/Outline</a>.
