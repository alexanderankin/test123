<H2>Outline plugin</H2>

<p>Provides a SideKick tree parser which displays folds rather than language-specific structures.
With Indent folds, Outline can be a parser for Python, as well as most other structured programming languages. With Explicit folds, Outline works quite well for jEdit source code.
</p>


<p>In theory, Outline will work with any folding mode other than the SideKick folding mode.
Implementing Sidekick Folding Mode in Outline is actually not possible since that would create a
circular dependency between sidekick and folds: each requiring info from the other before
folds or the tree could be displayed. Just thinking about it makes me dizzy. </footnote></p>
