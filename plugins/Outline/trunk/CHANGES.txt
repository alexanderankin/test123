{{{ CHANGES
{{{ 1.2.1
	- Removed actions file that had been copied from ColumnRuler and was causing problems.
    - Small bugfixes with SideKick 0.7
}}}

{{{ 1.1.2
	 - Offered a sidekick service in services.xml. Since sidekick 0.6 has a combobox
	 that lets you switch between outline and other native parsers, it should be quite convenient
	 to use that way, instead of in its own dockable.
}}}
{{{ 1.1.0
	- Tree expansion and fold expansion are synchronized
	
	- Changed asset descriptions to display line ranges
}}}
