This plugin causes a pop up to be displayed whenever the user presses a shortcut prefix. The pop up contains all the possible completions and the name of the action. The idea here is to help us mortals learn more of the built-in functionality jEdit has, or to make use of more of them even when we don't remember the keyboard shortcuts.
