<b>Introduction:</b>
<br>
The Navigator Plugin provides a set of "Back" and "Forward" similar to a web browser. This is surprisingly handy. Click around through several files, click the "Back" and "Forward" buttons to retrace your path.
<p>
<b>Configuration:</b>
<br>
The Navigator can be docked. The top or bottom docking positions are generally the best fit. Use the standard docking configuration dialog under "Utilities" -> "Global Options" -> "Docking".
<p>
The Navigator can also be added to the toolbar. This can be done in one of
two ways:
<ol>
<li>If docked, check the "Show on toolbar" checkbox to move the "Back" and "Forward" buttons to the jEdit toolbar, uncheck to move them back to the docked plugin panel.</li>
<li>If not docked, use the "Plugins" menu, then "Navigator", then check the "Show on toolbar" box.</li>
</ol>
