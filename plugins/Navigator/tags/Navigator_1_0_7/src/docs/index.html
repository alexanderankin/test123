<b>Introduction:</b>
</p>
<p> The Navigator Plugin provides a set of "Back" and "Forward" actions similar to a web browser. This is surprisingly handy. 
</p>
<p>
<b>Configuration:</b>
</p>
<p>
The Navigator works in a "visible" or an "invisible" way. I find it is handy to use shortcut keys for the actions "back" and "forward".
</p>

<p>
The Navigator buttons can become visible in 2 ways:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to Global Options - ToolBar, add a button to the toolbar. Select the drop-down menu that lists all of the installed plugins, choose "Navigator" and you should see a list of Navigator's actions. Add "Back" and "Forward" actions to your toolbar, and move them to the desired location. </li>

<li>Go to Global Options - Docking and add a dockable for the Navigtor to one of the docking areas. These buttons will grey out if the corresponding stacks are empty.  </li>
</ol>
