<b>Introduction:</b>
</p>
<p>
The Navigator Plugin provides a set of "Back" and "Forward" similar to a web browser. This is surprisingly handy. Click around through several files, click the "Back" and "Forward" buttons to retrace your path.
</p>
<p>
<b>Configuration:</b>
</p>
<p>
The Navigator works in a "visible" or an "invisible" way. I find it is handy to use shortcut keys for the actions "back" and "forward".
By default, it uses Alt-BackArrow and Alt-ForwardArrow, like firefox.
</p>

<p>
The Navigator can be added to the toolbar in 2 ways.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Check the "Show on toolbar" checkbox to move the "Back" and "Forward" buttons to the jEdit view toolbar, uncheck to make it invisible again.
</li>
<li>Go to Global Options - Docking and add a dockable for the Navigtor to one of the docking areas. </li>
</ul>
