<h1>Subversion Plugin</h1>

<p>
First attempt at a Subversion plugin.  Access the commands via the context
menu in ProjectViewer.  Set/view repository location in ProjectViewer
Properties.  Set username and password (if required) for checkout in
ProjectViewer Properties.
</p>

<strong>
This plugin complies with Subversion 1.4.  If you use an older Subversion
client that is pre-1.4, you may have some problems.  Subversion changed the
format of the files stored in the .svn directories with 1.4.  All 1.4
compliant clients will automatically and silently convert the format of
those files, which will render them unreadable by older clients.  If you
must continue to use your older client and are unable to upgrade it to be
Subversion 1.4 compatible, you should not use this plugin.

To check out a project that already exists in subversion:
<ol>
<li>Click on Plugins - Subversion - Checkout</li>
<li>Enter the repository URL, username, and password.  Leave username and password
blank if the repository allows anonymous access.  Don't forget to add "/trunk" to the
end of the URL, unless you want all the branch and tag info locally.</li>
<li>Click the "OK" button.</li>
<li>Wait for the files to be checked out.</li>
<li>Follow the remaining dialogs to create a project in ProjectViewer from these files.</li>
</ol>
