<h1>Subversion Plugin</h1>
<p>
Author: Dale Anson
<p>
First attempt at a Subversion plugin.  Access the commands via the context
menu in ProjectViewer.  Set/view repository location in ProjectViewer
Properties.  Set username and password (if required) for checkout in
ProjectViewer Properties.
</p>

<strong>
This plugin complies with Subversion 1.4.  If you use an older Subversion
client that is pre-1.4, you may have some problems.  Subversion changed the
format of the files stored in the .svn directories with 1.4.  All 1.4
compliant clients will automatically and silently convert the format of
those files, which will render them unreadable by older clients.  If you
must continue to use your older client and are unable to upgrade it to be
Subversion 1.4 compatible, you should not use this plugin.
