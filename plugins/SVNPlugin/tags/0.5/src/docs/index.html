<h1>Subversion Plugin</h1>
<p>
Author: Dale Anson
<p>
A plugin for using Subversion from within jEdit.  This is an all Java implementation,
no external libraries or subversion clients are required.  This plugin is tightly
integrated with ProjectViewer, and most commands are available by right clicking on
files or folders in the ProjectViewer trees.
</p>

<p>
<strong>
This plugin complies with Subversion 1.4.  If you use an older Subversion
client that is pre-1.4, you may have some problems.  Subversion changed the
format of the files stored in the .svn directories with 1.4.  All 1.4
compliant clients will automatically and silently convert the format of
those files, which will render them unreadable by older clients.  If you
must continue to use your older client and are unable to upgrade it to be
Subversion 1.4 compatible, you should not use this plugin.

<p>
<b>Usage:</b> Most actions are accessed directly from the "Folders" tree in
ProjectViewer by right-clicking on an item.  Most items should be obvious to
Subversion users as to what those actions do.
</p>
<p>
There are 2 dockables, "SVN" and "SVN Browser".  These are available via the
jEdit standard Utilities - Global Options - Docking dialog.
</p>
<p>The "SVN" dockable
shows an SVN console, which displays the detailed raw output of each plugin action,
and a tab for the results of each subversion action.  The tabs may be removed by
right-clicking on the tab, then clicking "Close" or "Close All".  The SVN Console
tab cannot be closed.
</p>
<p>The "SVN Browser" dockable allows the user to enter the URL to a Subversion
repository and drill down into the various folders of that repository via a tree
interface.  Click the "New" button to enter a new repository location.  The
last 10 locations are stored in the drop-down for reuse.  There are a number
of actions available by right-clicking on items in the tree, including the
ability to edit the repository location and to checkout files.  Double-clicking
on a file will open the file as a temporary file in jEdit.  The file name will
be slightly different than the file name in the repository, the browser adds the
revision number to the file name.  This is done so that two different revisions
can exist in the same directory without overwriting each other.  For example,
if you double click on a file named /path/to/my/filename.java, you'll get a file
in your temp directory with the same directory structure like
/tmp/path/to/my/filename-1.java.  The "-1" in the filename indicates you have
the head revision of the file.  If you get revision 123 of the file, then it
would be /tmp/path/to/my/filename123.java.

<p>
To check out a project that already exists in a Subversion repository:
<ol>
<li>Click on Plugins - Subversion - Checkout, or alternately, use the SVN Browser
to open a repository, right click on the appropriate folder and choose "Checkout"
from the popup menu.</li>
<li>Enter the repository URL, username, and password.  Leave username and password
blank if the repository allows anonymous access.  Don't forget to add "/trunk" to the
end of the URL, unless you want all the branch and tag info locally.</li>
<li>Click the "OK" button.</li>
<li>Wait for the files to be checked out.</li>
<li>Follow the remaining dialogs to create a project in ProjectViewer from these files.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
Here's my "to do" list, which is basically to emulate the "Team" menu in
Eclipse:
<ul>
<li>synchronize - in progress (status + actions, need more actions).  Right-click
on entries in the results panels for actions.</li>
<li>update - in progress, does an update on the selected item with an option to recursively update.  Also available from the synchronize results.  Still need to add a dialog to allow an update at a specific revision.</li>
<li>commit - done, lets the user enter a comment or choose a previously entered comment, and optionally do a recursive commit.  Also available from the synchronize results.</li>
<li>create patch</li>
<li>apply patch</li>
<li>--</li>
<li>revert - done, does a simple revert of the selected item, can recurse if the item is a directory.  Also available from the synchronize results.</li>
<li>add - done, optionally allows an add.  Also available from the synchronize results.</li>
<li>ignore</li>
<li>edit conflicts</li>
<li>resolved - done</li>
<li>--</li>
<li>lock</li>
<li>unlock</li>
<li>--</li>
<li>tag</li>
<li>branch</li>
<li>merge</li>
<li>switch</li>
<li>--</li>
<li>show properties</li>
<li>set properties</li>
<li>set keywords</li>
<li>--</li>
<li>history - done</li>
<li>annotations</li>
<li>--</li>
<li>copy</li>
<li>export</li>
<li>cleanup - done</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
There will be a "compare" to open a diff.  This needs a dialog to be
able to pick a specific revision to compare the local file to, or to
diff two non-local revisions.  Need to pop this as an option in the log
viewer.
