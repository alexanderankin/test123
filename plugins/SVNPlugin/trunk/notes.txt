Eclipse has these in the Team menu, I'm using that as my model for user actions for the context menu in ProjectViewer:

synchronize - in progress (status + actions, need more actions)
update - done
commit - done
(not in Eclipse, I added "diff" here)
create patch
apply patch
--
revert - done
add - done
ignore
edit conflicts
resolved - done
(not in Eclipse, I added "delete" here)
--
lock
unlock
--
tag
branch
merge
switch
--
show properties
set properties
set keywords
--
history - done, this is the same as "log"
annotations
--
copy
export
cleanup - done


There should be a "compare" to open a diff.  This needs a dialog to be
able to pick a specific revision to compare the local file to, or to
diff two non-local revisions.  Need to pop this as an option in the log
viewer. - done, I called it "diff" rather than "compare" and am using JDiff
plugin rather than svn diff.



The basic subversion commands:

svn add - done
svn blame
svn cat
svn checkout - done
svn cleanup - done
svn commit - done
svn copy
svn delete - done
svn diff - done
svn export
svn help
svn import
svn info - done
svn list
svn lock
svn log - done
svn merge
svn mkdir
svn move
svn propdel
svn propedit
svn propget
svn proplist
svn propset
svn resolved - done
svn revert - done
svn status - done
svn switch
svn unlock
svn update - done
