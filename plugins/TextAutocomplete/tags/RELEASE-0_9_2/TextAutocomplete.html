<h2><a name="About">About</a></h2>

<p>TextAutocomplete collects "words" in the current buffer and those that you
type and offers you automatically a list of possible completions. It's pretty
similar to the jEdit's function "Complete Word" but it's automatic, you don't
need to press any key to invoke the list of completions. Contrary to
"Complete Word" it doesn't search the buffer every time for possible
completions. Instead of that it keeps a list of remembered words (i.e.
possible completions) that is created by parsing the buffer at startup and is
updated with new words that you type. You can export (save), import and
modify the list of remembered words. The plugin was inspired by a similar
functionality in OpenOffice.org.</p>

<p>The plugin is configurable, you can define what is a "word", what words
(not) to remember etc. - see below. It's also possible to modify manually the
list of remembered words.</p>

<p>You must enable the autocompletion manually for every buffer where you
want it (Plugins - TextAutocomplete - Start for buffer). Alternatively, you
can enable the autocompletion for all buffers (Plugins - TextAutocomplete -
Start for all buffers) or set the plugin to start automatically for every new
buffer that you open (Plugins - Plugin Options... - TextAutocomplete - check
"Start autom. for new buffers").</p>

<h2><a name="Words" id="Words">Words, completions and how does it
work</a></h2>

<p>As described above, the plugin parses the buffer and what you type to find
and remember the words to offer as completions later on. But what is a word
and when/how is the list of completions offered?</p>

<p>To consider a string as a word it must pass some tests - see the options
"Belongs to word?" and "Is word to remember?". The first one determines
whether the character typed may start/extend a word or whether it ends one,
i.e. whether it is a word separator or a word constituent. By default only
letters are regarded as constituting a word. The second option may be used to
limit what words are remembered as possible completions - by default we
ignore words shorter than determined by the option "Remember words long at
least".</p>

<p>The pop-up window with completions appears when you type the beginning of
a word long enough (assuming there are some completions for that prefix). The
length is given by the option "Minimal prefix length". So, with the default
setting, you must type at least two letters before the completions may be
offered.</p>

<p><a name="L590" id="L590"></a>The important thing to note is that even
though you can add arbitrary string to the list of remembered words (by
importing them from a file or by adding the string by means of the
"Remembered words" dialog), it will <em>never be offered as a completion</em>
unless it satisfies the condition for the pop-up completions window to turn
up, in other words it must start with a word that is at least as long as the
"Minimal prefix length" - under the default setting it must start with two
letters.</p>

<p>Please be aware that the words are <em>case sensitive</em>, so
"Something", "something" and "someTHING" are three different words.</p>

<h2><a name="Control">Control keys of the completions pop-up window</a></h2>

<p>By default, the following keys may be used to control the completion
pop-up window:</p>
<ul>
  <li><kbd>Escape</kbd> - Cancel (dispose) the window.</li>
  <li><kbd>Enter</kbd>, <kbd>Tab</kbd> - Accept and insert the selected
    completion.</li>
  <li><kbd>Up arrow</kbd> - Select the completion above the currently
    selected one. It cycles through the list, so pressing Up on the first
    entry gets you to the last one.</li>
  <li><kbd>Down arrow</kbd> - Select the completion below the currently
    selected one. It cycles through the list.</li>
  <li>Numbers <kbd>0-9</kbd> - Accept and insert the completion with the
    given number.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="Menu">Menu</a></h2>

    <dd>Display the list of remember words that you can edit: <br>

      <ol>
        <li><em>Add a word</em> typed in the text field; the string is
          remembered as is, even if normally it wouldn't be considered to be

    <dd>Additionally, you can:
      <ol>
        <li><em>Import words</em> - read a file with previously saved words
          and add them to the list. One line is considered as one word and is
          added to the list "as is" even if it wouldn't normally be
          considered as a word - but it should start as a word, see the <a
          href="#L590">explanation</a> above.</li>
        <li><em>Export words</em> - save the remembered words into a file,

      </ol>
    </dd>
  <dt><strong>Start for all buffers</strong></dt>
    <dd>Enable autocompletion for all currently opened buffers. (To detach
      from all buffers, open the Plugin Manager and under Manage uncheck and
      re-check the TextAutocomplete plugin.)</dd>
  <dt><strong>Stop for all buffers</strong></dt>
    <dd>Disable autocompletion for all buffers that have it enabled and
      forget all remembered words.</dd>
</dl>

<h2 id="Options"><a name="Options">Options</a></h2>

<p>It's possible to set some options that will apply to autocompletion in all
buffers.</p>

<p>When you put the mouse pointer above some of the text field on the option
page and wait for a while, a tool tip with more detailed description will
show up.</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Start autom. for new buffers</dt>
    <dd>Enable autocompletion for every new buffer that you will open from
      that moment on.<br>
      Default: Off</dd>
</dl>

<p>The following options influence words and completions.</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Remember at max. words</dt>
    <dd>The maximal number of words that should be remembered as potential
      completions. Notice, that completions are only offered based on the
      list of remembered words.<br>
      Default: 1000</dd>
  <dt>Minimal prefix length</dt>
    <dd>Don't offer possible completions until at least the given number of
      characters have been typed.</dd>
    <dd>Default: 2.</dd>
  <dt>Remember words long at least</dt>
    <dd>Don't remember words shorter than the given value.</dd>
    <dd>Default: 5.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Value of the following properties is a beanshell expression that evaluates
to either true or false. It can make use of special variables - see below. If
the code isn't correct, BeanShell will throw an exception when it is first
executed so you should make sure that it is all right; than it reverts to the
default setting to prevent repetitions of the same error. The description of
such an exception will mention either PreferencesManager.precompileCode or
PreferencesManager.executeCachedCode and either the method accept (for
"Belongs to word?") or isWordToRemember. The expression must be valid Java
expression, so it should end with a semicolon.</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Is word to remember? [code]</dt>
    <dd>Return true if the word that has just been typed should be
      remembered. In addition to that, the word must also be at least as long
      as required by "Remember words long at least". The variable
      <code>word</code> (String) holds the word in question.</dd>
    <dd>Example: <code>! word.startsWith("X");</code></dd>
    <dd>Default: always true</dd>
  <dt>Belongs to word? [code]</dt>
    <dd>Return true when the insertion (the typed character) doesn't end the
      word being typed, in other words, it must return false for word
      separators. The available variables are <var>prefix</var> (String; the
      word that has been typed so far) and <var>insertion</var> (char; the
      newly typed character). This determines what is considered as a word
      while the previous option determines whether something, that is already
      considered to be a word, should be remembered or not.</dd>
    <dd>Example: <code>Character.isLetterOrDigit(insertion) || insertion ==
      '_' || (word.startsWith("&lt;") &amp;&amp; word.indexOf("&gt;") ==
      -1);</code> // alphanumeric string or anything between &lt; and
    &gt;</dd>
    <dd>Default: <code>Character.isLetter(insertion);</code></dd>
</dl>

<p>Use the following properties to change the <a href="#Control">default
control keys</a> (see above). All of them take a list of keys separated by a
single space or by a comma. A key is represented by the name of one of the
constants of the class <a
href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/index.html">java.awt.event.KeyEvent</a>
that start with the prefix "VK_". You can only use special keys, that means
keys that don't produce a character. It includes VK_ENTER, VK_ESCAPE,
VK_BACK_SPACE, VK_DELETE, VK_F1 etc., VK_TAB, VK_UP, VK_DOWN and others.</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Accept with key</dt>
    <dd>Accept and insert the currently selected completion.</dd>
    <dd>Default: VK_ENTER,VK_TAB</dd>
  <dt>Dispose with key</dt>
    <dd>Hide the window with completions.</dd>
    <dd>Default: VK_ESCAPE</dd>
  <dt>Up in completions key</dt>
    <dd>Select the completion above.</dd>
    <dd>Default: VK_UP</dd>
  <dt>Down in completions key</dt>
    <dd>Select the completion below.</dd>
    <dd>Default: VK_DOWN</dd>
</dl>

<p>The button <var>Reset options</var> resets them to the default values.</p>

<h2><a name="Accessing" id="Accessing">Accessing the plugin from
BeanShell</a></h2>

<p>If you know Java programming, you can access and control the plugin via
BeanShell - either by means of the Console plugin or from a macro.</p>

<p>You can see the current options by calling the methods of
PreferencesManager, for example<br>
<code>net.jakubholy.jedit.autocomplete.PreferencesManager.getPreferencesManager().getMaxCountOfWords()</code><br>
To modify the options you'd need to set some properties (jEdit.setProperty) -
see the file TextAutocomplete.props within the plugin's .jar archive.</p>

<p>You could also invoke the actions that are usually run from the menu - for
example
<code>net.jakubholy.jedit.autocomplete.AutoComplete.attachAction(buffer)</code>.</p>

<p>To get the AutoComplete associated with the buffer, call
<code>net.jakubholy.jedit.autocomplete.getAutoCompleteOfBuffer(buffer)</code>.
If it returns null, you must attach one first.</p>

<h3><a name="Wish">Wish list</a></h3>
<ul>
  <li>Options - check that the beanshell expressions are ok before the
    preferences are saved</li>
  <li>Handle backspace - don't dispose the completion window but offer
    completions for the shortened prefix.</li>
  <li>Allow for the insertion of longer texts after a prefix (so far only 1
    character can be inserted/typed)</li>
  <li>Support the insertion of the "longest common suffix" of two or more
    completions (typed: "co", possible completions: community, communist
    =&gt; insert (co)mmuni)</li>
  <li>Add limit for the number of words to remember.</li>
  <li>Option to attach automatically to all newly opened buffers.</li>
  <li>Option to show the completion popup only after a period of inactivity
    (e.g. when the user stops typing for 2 seconds).</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="Change">Change Log</a></h3>

<h4>Version 0.9.2, April 2006</h4>

<p>This is a bug fixes and enhancement release. Additionally, the plugin has
been updated for jEdit 4.3pre3.</p>

<p>Bug fixes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Prevent the cursor from switching buffer/view: When you edited one or
    two file(s) in a split view, it sometimes happened that you started
    writing in one and suddenly the cursor jumped into the another. This
    should be now fixed (We prefer jEdit.getActiveView over the remembered
    view). I'd like to thank Jeremias, who discovered the bug.</li>
</ul>

<p>New features:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Start for all opened buffers and Stop for all opened buffers</li>
  <li>Start automatically for new buffers</li>
  <li>The number of remembered words is now limited to 1000, the limit may be
    changed.</li>
  <li>It's now possible to export/import (append) the list of remembered
    words.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="Version">Version 0.9, May 2006</h4>

<p>Initial release.</p>

<h3><a name="Overview">Overview of the Classes</a></h3>

<p>Core classes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>AutoComplete - ties together all the core classes: registers a
    WordTypedListener for the buffer, stores the words into a WordList and
    displays a CompletionPopup window with the possible completions. It keeps
    the map (buffer to its autocompletion instance).</li>
  <li>PreferencesManager - handles options; other classes use its methods and
    do not access the preferences directly. Only one instance exists.</li>
  <li>CompletionPopup - Pop-up window with completions of the word being
    typed. It intercepts keys and handles the control keys.</li>
  <li>WordList [interface] - structure for storage of the words (more exactly
    completions) to remember.</li>
  <li>WordListTreeSet - a concrete implementation of the WordList.</li>
  <li>WordTypedListener - it listens to what keys are typed in the buffer and
    notifies others (the AutoComplete) about such events as a character being
    appended to a word and the end of a word.</li>
</ul>

<p>GUI classes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>TextAutocompletePlugin - implements jEdit plugin.</li>
  <li>TextAutocompletePane - the Option pane.</li>
  <li>WordListEditorUI - the editor of remembered words.</li>
</ul>

<p>Helper classes</p>
<ul>
  <li>Completion - the structure used to keep a word to remember. Using it
    instead of a string enables us to add later on additional information to
    each word and, for instance, offer completions order with respect to the
    frequency of their occurrence.</li>
  <li>WordTypedEvent - produced by WordTypedListener to carry information
    about what's going on in the buffer.</li>
  <li>ActionException - thrown when some of the actions invoked via menu
    fails.</li>
</ul>

<p>For more info see <a
href="http://jakubholy.net/comp/jedit.html">http://jakubholy.net/comp/jedit.html</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="Working">How does it work?</a></h3>

<p>A BufferListener (implemented by my WordTypedListener) is attached to the
buffer. When it detects an important event (a letter appended to a word, a
word ended...), it notifies the main class AutoComplete via the
Observer/Observable mechanism. It may then display (or dispose) a list of
completions. When the list of completions is displayed, it intercepts special
keys being pressed (such as Enter, Escape...) and reacts according to its
setting (hide itself, insert the selected completion...).</p>
