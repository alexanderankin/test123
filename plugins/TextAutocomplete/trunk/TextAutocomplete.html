<h2 id="About">About</h2>

<p>TextAutocomplete collects "words" in the current buffer and those that you
type and offers you automatically a list of possible completions. It's pretty
similar to the jEdit's function "Complete Word" but it's automatic, you don't
need to press any key to invoke the list of completions. The plugin was
inspired by a similar functionality in OpenOffice.org.</p>

<p>The plugin is configurable, you can define what is a "word", what words
(not) to remember etc. - see below. It's also possible to modify manually the
list of remembered words.</p>

<h2 id="Control1"><a name="Control" id="Control">Control keys</a></h2>

<p>By default, the following keys may be used to control the completion
pop-up window:</p>
<ul>
  <li><kbd>Escape</kbd> - Cancel (dispose) the window.</li>
  <li><kbd>Enter</kbd>, <kbd>Tab</kbd> - Accept and insert the selected
    completion.</li>
  <li><kbd>Up arrow</kbd> - Select the completion above the currently
    selected one. It cycles through the list, so pressing Up on the first
    entry gets you to the last one.</li>
  <li><kbd>Down arrow</kbd> - Select the completion below the currently
    selected one. It cycles through the list.</li>
  <li>Numbers <kbd>0-9</kbd> - Accept and insert the completion with the
    given number.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Menu">Menu</h2>
<dl>
  <dt><strong>Start for buffer</strong></dt>
    <dd>Enable autocompletion for the current buffer. The buffer is parsed to
      collect the words that already exist in it.</dd>
  <dt><strong>Stop for buffer</strong></dt>
    <dd>Disable autocompletion for the current buffer and forget all
      remembered words.</dd>
  <dt><strong>Parse buffer</strong></dt>
    <dd>Scan the current buffer for words to remember and add them to the
      list of remembered words.</dd>
  <dt><strong>Show remembered words</strong></dt>
    <dd>Display the list of remember words that you can edit: <br>

      <ol>
        <li><em>Add a word</em> typed in the text field; the string is
          remembered as is, even if normally it wouldn't be considered to be
          a word.</li>
        <li><em>Delete selected</em> - forgets the words you've selected in
          the list. To select multiple entries use Control+click.</li>
        <li><em>Delete all</em> - forget all remembered words. You can Parse
          buffer to get them back.</li>
      </ol>
    </dd>
</dl>

<h2 id="Options">Options</h2>

<p>It's possible to set some options that will apply to autocompletion in all
buffers. </p>

<p>When you put the mouse pointer above some of the text field on the option
page and wait for a while, a tool tip with more detailed description will
show up.</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Minimal prefix length</dt>
    <dd>Don't offer possible completions until at least the given number of
      characters have been typed.</dd>
    <dd>Default: 2.</dd>
  <dt>Remember words long at least</dt>
    <dd>Don't remember words shorter than the given value.</dd>
    <dd>Default: 5.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Value of the following properties is a beanshell expression that evaluates
to either true or false. It can make use of special variables - see below. If
the code isn't correct, BeanShell will throw an exception when it is first
executed so you should make sure that it is all right. The description of
such an exception will mention PreferencesManager.evaluateCode and either the
method accept (for "Belongs to word?") or isWordToRemember. The expression
must be valid Java expression, so it should end with a semicolon.</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Is word to remember? [code]</dt>
    <dd>Return true if the word that has just been typed should be
      remembered. In addition to that, the word must also be at least as long
      as required by "Remember words long at least". The variable
      <code>word</code> (String) holds the word in question.</dd>
    <dd>Example: <code>! word.startsWith("X");</code></dd>
    <dd>Default: always true</dd>
  <dt>Belongs to word? [code]</dt>
    <dd>Return true when the insertion (the typed character) doesn't end the
      word being typed, in other words, it must return false for word
      separators. The available variables are <var>prefix</var> (String; the
      word that has been typed so far) and <var>insertion</var> (char; the
      newly typed character).</dd>
    <dd>Example: <code>Character.isLetterOrDigit(insertion) || insertion ==
      '_' || (word.startsWith("&lt;") &amp;&amp; word.indexOf("&gt;") ==
      -1);</code> // alphanumeric string or anything between &lt; and
    &gt;</dd>
    <dd>Default: <code>Character.isLetter(insertion);</code></dd>
</dl>

<p>Use the following properties to change the <a href="#Control">default
control keys</a> (see above). All of them take a list of keys separated by a
single space or by a comma. A key is represented by the name of one of the
constants of the class <a
href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/index.html">java.awt.event.KeyEvent</a>
that start with the prefix "VK_". You can only use special keys, that means
keys that don't produce a character. It includes VK_ENTER, VK_ESCAPE,
VK_BACK_SPACE, VK_DELETE, VK_F1 etc., VK_TAB, VK_UP, VK_DOWN and others.</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Accept with key</dt>
    <dd>Accept and insert the currently selected completion.</dd>
    <dd>Default: VK_ENTER,VK_TAB</dd>
  <dt>Dispose with key</dt>
    <dd>Hide the window with completions.</dd>
    <dd>Default: VK_ESCAPE</dd>
  <dt>Up in completions key</dt>
    <dd>Select the completion above.</dd>
    <dd>Default: VK_UP</dd>
  <dt>Down in completions key</dt>
    <dd>Select the completion below.</dd>
    <dd>Default: VK_DOWN</dd>
</dl>

<p>The button <var>Reset options</var> resets them to the default values.</p>

<h3 id="Feedback">Feedback</h3>

<p>The preferred way to send bug reports is to use the Sourceforge Bug
Tracker at <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/bugs/?group_id=588">http://sourceforge.net/bugs/?group_id=588</a>
and also notify me by e-mail.</p>

<p>You can also write to:</p>

<p>Jakub Holý alias MalyVelky &lt;malyvelky@users.sourceforge.net&gt;;</p>

<h3 id="Wish">Wish list</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Options - check that the beanshell expressions are ok before the
    preferences are saved</li>
  <li>Handle backspace - don't dispose the completion window but offer
    completions for the shortened prefix.</li>
  <li>Allow for the insertion of longer texts after a prefix (so far only 1
    character can be inserted/typed)</li>
  <li>Support the insertion of the "longest common suffix" of two or more
    completions (typed: "co", possible completions: community, communist
    =&gt; insert (co)mmuni)</li>
  <li>Add limit for the number of words to remember.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="Change">Change Log</h3>

<h4 id="Version">Version 0.9, May 2006</h4>

<p>Initial release.</p>

<h3 id="Overview">Overview of the Classes</h3>

<p>Core classes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>AutoComplete - ties together all the core classes: registers a
    WordTypedListener for the buffer, stores the words into a WordList and
    displays a CompletionPopup window with the possible completions. It keeps
    the map (buffer to its autocompletion instance).</li>
  <li>PreferencesManager - handles options; other classes use its methods and
    do not access the preferences directly. Only one instance exists.</li>
  <li>CompletionPopup - Pop-up window with completions of the word being
    typed. It intercepts keys and handles the control keys.</li>
  <li>WordList [interface] - structure for storage of the words (more exactly
    completions) to remember.</li>
  <li>WordListTreeSet - a concrete implementation of the WordList.</li>
  <li>WordTypedListener - it listens to what keys are typed in the buffer and
    notifies others (the AutoComplete) about such events as a character being
    appended to a word and the end of a word. </li>
</ul>

<p>GUI classes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>TextAutocompletePlugin - implements jEdit plugin.</li>
  <li>TextAutocompletePane - the Option pane.</li>
  <li>WordListEditorUI - the editor of remembered words.</li>
</ul>

<p>Helper classes</p>
<ul>
  <li>Completion - the structure used to keep a word to remember. Using it
    instead of a string enables us to add later on additional information to
    each word and, for instance, offer completions order with respect to the
    frequency of their occurrence.</li>
  <li>WordTypedEvent - produced by WordTypedListener to carry information
    about what's going on in the buffer.</li>
  <li>ActionException - thrown when some of the actions invoked via menu
    fails.</li>
</ul>
