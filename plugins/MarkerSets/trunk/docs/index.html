The MarkerSets plugin enables you to maintain named sets of markers, where each
set can contain markers from various files. The plugin has a dockable window
where you can view or change the marker sets. Each marker set has an associated
color which is used for painting its markers.
</p>
<p>
To toggle a marker, put the caret on the desired line, and select "Toggle marker
at caret line" from the plugin menu. You can associate this menu item with a
keyboard shortcut or a toolbar button using the Global Options dialog. New
markers are added to the active marker set.<br>
</p>
<p>
The "Marker Sets" dockable shows you all existing markers and allows you to
manage the marker sets:
<ul>
<li>Switch between several styles of the marker tree using the "Group markers
by:" combo-box.
<li>Limit the markers shown in the tree to the current buffer using the "Buffer
scope" check-box.
<li>The context menu of each marker in the tree allows you to jump to it, remove
it or set a shortcut for it.
<li>Change the active marker set (the one to which new markers are added) using
the "Active marker set:" combo-box.
<li>Press the "New..." button to create a new marker set.
<li>Move between markers using the arrow buttons.
</ul>
</p>
<p>
The plugin menu allows you to export the marker sets to an XML file, and also to
import them from an XML file. Marker sets are persistent, so when you quit jEdit
and restart it later, they are automatically restored from a file.
