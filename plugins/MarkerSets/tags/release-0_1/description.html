This plugin provides a class hierarchy browser based on information from Ctags. It displays the hierarchy tree (both base and derived classes), as well as the list of members of the selected class, including inherited members (if requested), and provides filters to hide members of specific types.
You can quickly jump to the definition of any of the displayed classes/members. ClassBrowser uses the CtagsInterface plugin to retrieve the tag information and to jump to definitions.
To make the best use of ClassBrowser, configure CtagsInterface to run Ctags with "--fields=+anzKiS".
