The MarkerSets plugin enables the creation of several named sets of markers.
Each set can include markers on various files, including files that are not
open in jEdit. Each set may have its own color for the markers in the gutter.
The marker sets are persistent, and in addition, there are actions for
exporting the marker sets to XML and importing them from XML.
The plugin provides a dockable for viewing and managing the marker sets. The
marker sets are shown in a configurable tree, somewhat similar to the
HyperSearch Results dockable.
