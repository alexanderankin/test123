<p>The FTP plugin plugs into jEdit's virtual filesystem to allow transparent access to (S)FTP servers. It integrates with the filesystem browser (hence you can do things like add favorites which point to remote servers, and such), caches remote directory listings for improved performance, remembers passwords, and has optional support for passive-mode FTP.</p>
