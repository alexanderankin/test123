- 4.2 symlinkPath in VFS.DirectoryEntry
- implement backups
- a lot of the ConnectionManager stuff is just wrappers around the VFS
  API trying to make it look sane. it should be moved into the core.
- canonPath() should give all paths a port number for consistency.
- user name field: enter does not work
- support // in path
- DirectoryCache.clearAllCachedDirectories should remove all cache-* files
  not just the ones its Hashtable knows about, so it cleans up from crashes
  better. (Must not delete .passwd file)
