The FTP plugin allows you to browse directories and edit files on remote FTP
sites. In previous jEdit versions, FTP support was in the editor core; as
of jEdit 2.7, it has been moved into a plugin.<p>

To connect to an FTP server, either select <b>Connect to FTP Server</b> from a
VFS browser's <b>More</b> menu, or use the
<b>Open from FTP Server</b> and <b>Save to FTP Server</b> commands in the
<b>Plugins</b>&gt;<b>FTP</b> menu.<p>

jEdit caches remote directory listings to improve performance. Changing files
from within jEdit will automatically update the cache as necessary. However, if
changes are made from another program, you will need to clear the cache
manually using the <b>Clear Remote Directory Cache</b> command in the
<b>Plugins</b>&gt;<b>FTP</b>. To force jEdit to forget all passwords, use the
<b>Forget Remote Passwords</b> command in the same menu.<p>

By default the FTP plugin uses BINARY mode to transfer files.
This will preserve line endings when transfering files between systems with
different line separators (e.g. DOS, UN*X, Mac). This option may be disabled in
the Ftp options pane in the Plugin Options section of the Global Options pane.
When disabled files will be transfered with &quot;Network&quot; line endings 
(&quot;\r\n&quot; - same as DOS), but most FTP servers will translate these into
their native line separator upon upload. So you may use this mode when you would
like your saved files to conform to the server's notion of line separators.<p>

Upon download jEdit will leave the files in the Network (&quot;\r\n&quot;) mode if BINARY mode is 
not enabled. If BINARY mode is enabled the files will be opened in jEdit exactly
as they appear on the server, with their line endings identical to those in the server
copy of the file.
