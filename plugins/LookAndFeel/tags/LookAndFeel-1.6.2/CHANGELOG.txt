CHANGELOG for LookAndFeel plugin
================================

Version 1.6
-----------
* Refactored and revised the code to use the Service Manager.  All look and
feels are now registered as services.  The LnfInstaller is deprecated in favor
of the much simpler LookAndFeelInstaller that each service must implement.

* Removed the Substance LAF to a separate plugin.  It registers as a service to
this plugin, so it is loaded separately but acts exactly the same as before.

* Reduced the required Java version to 1.5.  The previous bump to 1.6 was due
to the Substance LAF requiring Java 1.6.  Since it is now a separate plugin, 
this plugin can be used in Java 1.5 VMs.

-----------
* Updated Substance LAF to version 6.0
