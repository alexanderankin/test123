This plugin provides a class hierarchy browser based on information from existing Ctags tag files. It displays the hierarchy tree (both base and derived classes), as well as the list of members of the selected class, including inherited members (if requested), and provides filters to hide members of specific types.
You can quickly jump to the definition of any of the displayed classes/members. ClassBrowser uses the Tags plugin to retrieve the list of tag files and to jump to definitions.
To make the best use of ClassBrowser, run Ctags with "--fields=+anzKiS".
