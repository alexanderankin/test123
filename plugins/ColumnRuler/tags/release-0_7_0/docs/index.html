<H2>Column Ruler plugin</H2>
The main purpose of this plugin is to provide a ruler above the text area which marks off columns, but it also provides the following features:
<UL>
<LI>Indicates caret column</LI>
<LI>Highlights the columns of the current selection (if there is one)</LI>
<LI>Displays the dimensions of the current selection (if there is one)</LI>
<LI>Marks the column where text is wrapped (if wrap is on)</LI>
<LI>Right-clicking lets you set the wrap mode</LI>
<LI>You can drag the wrap marker to set the buffer's wrap column</LI>
</UL>

<P>
If you're not using a fixed width font such as Courier the column ruler isn't going to do you much good.

<P>To Do:
<UL>
<LI>Multiple selections</LI>
<LI># of selected characters</LI>
<LI>Adjust when working in wrapped text</LI>
<LI>Integrate with Line guides?</LI>
<LI>Show selection info as tooltip</LI>
</UL>

<P>Bugs
<UL>
<LI>A null pointer is encountered when a file is opened.  Perhaps the ruler is trying to get some information before the text area is ready to provide it?
</LI>
</UL>

<P>I know that when selecting multiple lines it only highlights the difference between the start and end columns.  I don't think it would be very useful to highlight the entire ruler.  Same thing applies to 'Select All'.  Otherwise, send bugs, requests, or comments to <A HREF="mailto:mace0031@mrs.umn.edu">Brad Mace</A>
