<H2>Column Ruler plugin</H2>
The main purpose of this plugin is to provide a ruler above the text area which marks off columns, but it also provides the following features:
<h3>Features</h3>
<UL>
<LI>Highlights the columns of the current selection (if there is one)</LI>
<LI>Displays the dimensions of the current selection (if there is one)</LI>
<li>Displays number of selected characters in the status bar</li>
<li>add marks anywhere you want by double-clicking on ruler</li>
<li>Dynamic marks that follow caret and wrap column</li>
<LI>Right-clicking lets you set the wrap mode, and edit/delete marks</LI>
<LI>Drag marks along the ruler, double click them to toggle their guide</LI>
<LI>Can indicate the next tab stop</LI>
<LI>Line Guides</LI>
</UL>

<P>
If you're not using a fixed width font such as Courier the column ruler isn't going to do you much good.  
Also, <b>Fractional Font Metrics should be off</b> for proper alignment, though you may decide it's close enough with them on.
Go to <code>Utilities-&gt;Global Options-&gt;Text Area</code> to change the fractional font metrics setting.
</P>

<table border="1">
<tr><th colspan="2">Colors</th></tr>
<tr><th>Component</th><th>Color</th></tr>
<tr><td>Foreground</td><td>TextArea: text color</td></tr>
<tr><td>Background</td><td>configurable</td></tr>
<tr><td>Border</td><td>configurable</td></tr>
<tr><td>Ticks</td><td>Text Area: text color</td></tr>
<tr><td>Caret marker</td><td>Text Area: Caret</td></tr>
<tr><td>Wrap marker</td><td>Text Area: Wrap guide</td></tr>
<tr><td>Selection highlight</td><td>Text Area: Single selection</td></tr>
</table>

<P>I know that when selecting multiple lines it only highlights the difference between the start and end columns.  I don't think it would be very useful to highlight the entire ruler.  Same thing applies to 'Select All'.</P>
