Hi,

XmlParsedData is a subclass of SideKickParsedData, which has:

public DefaultMutableTreeNode root;

DefaultMutableTreeNode has a simple API for accessing nodes:

java.util.Enumeration children();
TreeNode getChildAt(int);

For each TreeNode, call getUserObject() which gives you an XmlTag
instance.

XmlTag has a lot of public members, among them:

String name;
Attributes attributes;
Position start;
Position end;

- schemas: element values should be choosable
- ids in xml.root's other children
    - it works now 
      still some strange NPE in jEditBuffer.markTokens() : under investigation
      Navigator silently catches it.
- CatalogProperties complaints
- ids are kind of hackish -- use something similar to a hypersearch result
- html files before parsing complete -- don't show CDATA in popup
- fix IBM JDK problem
- misplaced closing tags break everything
- &, < or > will show up twice if a DTD defines it
- xml insert: show CDATA, comment in list?
- xmlns attributes, XMLSchema-instance stuff
- TagParser: use segments, not strings
- instead of built-in completion info for xsd and xsl, pre-parse some
  schemas to validate these file types.
- preparsing and grammar cache needs a rework.
- clean up entity code
- empty data -- see what's up, & clean up
- 'advanced' option pane for selecting completion info files,
  built-in namespaces, etc.
- pluggable parsers, don't rely on Xerces-specific features, fail
  gracefully if some parser features are not available
    - on the contrary, XercesParserImpl is more and more tied to Xerces.
      This seems the way to go, as we depend on xerces plugin.
