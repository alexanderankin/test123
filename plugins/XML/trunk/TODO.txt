+ version 0.10:

- DTD downloader -- clear cache command should remove d/l'd files too
- &, < or > will show up twice if a DTD defines it
- still elements showing up twice?
- broken catalog support?

+ before 1.0:

- use AssetBrowser
- Xerces 2
- documentation: XML catalog format
- test XMLCatalog support, include an XMLCatalog DTD
- threaddeath -- wtf?
- id completion
- tag highlight scope bracket in gutter
- element and entity lists for schemas
- recording <, >, /, &
- move Xerces to its own plugin
- switching between two edit panes with same buffer: expand tree at
  appropriate location
- TagParser: use segments, not strings
- 'advanced' option pane for selecting parsers
- xalan integration:
  - merge with XSLT plugin?
  - 'xsl' parser validates stylesheets
- proper handling of tags in nested files
- handle parsing open buffers better
- let user specify completion info files in advanced option pane.
- new xml file wizard
- pluggable parsers, don't rely on Xerces-specific features, fail
  gracefully if some parser features are not available
