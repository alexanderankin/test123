+ version 0.9:

- no completions: backspace doesn't hide
- open file from VFS: DTD not loaded
- TagParser: use segments, not strings
- more friendly way to find DTDs (some kind of 'wizard'?)
- element and entity lists for schemas
- see if closing view causes problems
- recording <, >, /, &
- threaddeath -- wtf?
- move Xerces to its own plugin
- id completion
- switching between two edit panes with same buffer: expand tree at
  appropriate location
- documentation: XML catalog format, OASIS catalog format
- test XMLCatalog support, include an XMLCatalog DTD
- tag highlight scope bracket in gutter

+ before 1.0:

- 'advanced' option pane for selecting parsers
- xalan integration:
  - merge with XSLT plugin?
  - 'xsl' parser validates stylesheets
- features for editing dtds:
  - a different xml insert window lists <!ELEMENT, <!ATTLIST, ...
  - a different edit tag dialog for editing dtd declarations
  - list all dtd tags in xml tree
- proper handling of tags in nested files
- handle parsing open buffers better
- let user specify completion info files in advanced option pane.
- new xml file wizard
- pluggable parsers, don't rely on Xerces-specific features, fail
  gracefully if some parser features are not available
