+ version 0.8:

- catalog problem -- with catalogs added, cannot locate stuff in built-in
- more friendly way to find DTDs (some kind of 'wizard'?)
- add maybe DocBook DTDs
- recording <, >, /, &
- threaddeath -- wtf?
- 'advanced' option pane for selecting parsers
- use getContextSensitiveProperty()
- option to not fetch stuff from 'net
- tag hilite: respect syntax info
- id completion
- switching between two edit panes with same buffer: expand tree at
  appropriate location
- proper handling of tags in nested files
- documentation: XML catalog format, OASIS catalog format
- test XMLCatalog support, include an XMLCatalog DTD
- All/1/2/3/4 buttons in XML tree that expand/collapse tree that certain
  level
- handle parsing open buffers better
- let user specify completion info files in advanced option pane.

+ before 1.0:

- new xml file wizard
- pluggable parsers, don't rely on Xerces-specific features, fail
  gracefully if some parser features are not available
- maybe some features for editing dtds:
  - a different xml insert window lists <!ELEMENT, <!ATTLIST, ...
  - a different edit tag dialog for editing dtd declarations
  - list all dtd tags in xml tree
