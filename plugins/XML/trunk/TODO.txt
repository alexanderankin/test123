+ version 0.10:

- empty tag shown for tags with text inside; this should not happen
- finish element lists for schemas
- CDATA breaks getLastOpenTag() if the CDATA contains a <, also
  backward tag matching too
- DTD downloader -- clear cache command should remove d/l'd files too
- documentation: XML catalog format
- test XMLCatalog support, include an XMLCatalog DTD
- clean up entity code
- &, < or > will show up twice if a DTD defines it

+ version 1.0:

- xml insert: show CDATA in list?
- empty data -- see what's up, & clean up
- use pre9 mouse button API
- xmlns attributes, XMLSchema-instance stuff
- use AssetBrowser
- recording <, >, /, &
- switching between two edit panes with same buffer: expand tree at
  appropriate location
- TagParser: use segments, not strings
- proper handling of tags in nested files
- handle parsing open buffers better
- instead of built-in completion info for xsd and xsl, pre-parse some
  schemas to validate these file types.
- preparsing and grammar cache needs a rework.
- attribute completion.
- tag highlight scope bracket in gutter
- 'advanced' option pane for selecting parsers, completion info files,
  built-in namespaces, etc.
- pluggable parsers, don't rely on Xerces-specific features, fail
  gracefully if some parser features are not available
