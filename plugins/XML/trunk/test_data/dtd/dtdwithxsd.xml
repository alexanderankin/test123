<abstract> <para>  Slacker's Docbook is yet another Docbook preprocessor. It is a document format, plus scripts, stylesheets and libraries for converting documents into  standard Docbook/XML. Bulleted lists, conditional processing, subdocument and sourecode example inclusions, easy incorporation of images, and a host of other commonly faced problems are solved by Slacker's Docbook. In particular, it can be used to develop multiple versions (such as a textbook and overhead slides) of a document from a single source. This system was designed for writing computer science courseware (tutorials, assignments, exams), so it well suited for writing books that contain many sourcecode examples. </para>
