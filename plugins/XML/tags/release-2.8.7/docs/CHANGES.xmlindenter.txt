XMLIndenter: Change log
From 0.3 to 0.3.2 
	A space before the /> in an empty element is kept, e.g. <br /> remains unchanged.
	If the first attribute is on a new line it stays on a new line.
	If an attribute is on a new line but the next one isn't then the next one will not be placed on a new line.
	Requires >=jEdit 4.2 and >=XML plugin 0.12
From 0.2 to 0.3 
	Added options pane where user can configure a list of elements whose enclosing text nodes should have whitespace preserved.
