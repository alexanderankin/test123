<!-- :xml.root=fragment1.xml: -->
<!-- This dtd points to the document using it to be validated.
     This is to test what happens when a buffer uses xml.root
     and it is not parsed as a result of a missing xi:include in the root
     document or whatever.
     Contrary to dtd_with_xml_root.dtd, the root DOES NOT reference
     it and it is not parsed on first pass. 
     Ensure to set the Sidekick parser to XML manually.
     We get a warning and an error from 2nd parse because there is no xml element,
     only DTD
