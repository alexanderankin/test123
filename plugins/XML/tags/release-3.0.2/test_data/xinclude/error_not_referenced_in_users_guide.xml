<!-- This document points to a document not xi:including it.
     This is to test what happens when a buffer uses xml.root
     and it is not parsed as a result of a missing xi:include in the root
     document or whatever.
     We get a warning about that when parsing.
     Ignore the cvc-error, it's for another fragment referenced from users-guide.xml.
     See test_data/dtd/dtd_with_xml_root.dtd for an example with DTDs
     Try to type "<par" and get a completion for para, even if not
     referenced from users-guide.xml.
     Try to type "<para>" and parse again: you'll see an error in ErrorList.
