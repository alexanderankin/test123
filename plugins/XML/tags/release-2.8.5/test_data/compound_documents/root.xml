    - this is the root of a compound document, similar to
      user-guide.xml.
    - fragment1.xml and fragment2.xml are included via external entities
    - they both refer to this file as the root, so when parsing them,
      it's this document which is parsed and all irrelevant elements are ignored
    - IDs are collected across all fragments, for easy composition of xlinks
