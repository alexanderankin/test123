<h3>Javassist Plugin</h3>
Version: 3.20, August 31 2015<br/>
Author: Dale Anson
<p>
This plugin is a library plugin providing Javassist, a java byte code toolkit.
<p>
<a href="https://jboss-javassist.github.io/javassist/">https://jboss-javassist.github.io/javassist/</a>
<p>
The main purpose of this plugin is to provide a way to turn off the annoying 
"beeps" that the Swing UI likes to do on occasion. Since this must be done as 
part of the JVM boot process, it's not just a matter of activating the plugin 
like other plugins.
<p>
For this to work, it is required that both jEdit and all installed plugins
make their beep in the appropriate way. Typically, developers will use
<p>
<code>Toolkit.getDefaultToolkit().beep();</code>
<p>
<strong>This is the wrong way to make a beep.</strong> Beeping this way 
bypasses the LookAndFeel, which may have provided a different way to show the
user that there is something that needs their attention, like play a musical 
tune or flash the window.
<p>
<strong>This is the right way:</strong>
<p>
<code>UIManager.getLookAndFeel().provideErrorFeedback();</code>
<p>
The default implementation, which all JVM provided look and feels and most
custom look and feels use, simply calls <code>Toolkit.getDefaultToolkit().beep()</code>.
<p>
Since Javassist is a byte code manipulation library, it is fairly straightforward
to have it modify the <code>provideErrorFeedback</code> method to return early
from the method based on a System property.
<p>
To make this work, start jEdit like this:
<p>
<code>java -javaagent:/path/to/javassist.jar -jar /path/to/jedit.jar</code>
<p>

Since this is packaged as a standard jEdit plugin, by default, the plugin is
installed in the "jars" folder in the user settings directory. 
Note that this plugin is in two jar files, <code>javassist.jar</code> and <code>JavassistPlugin.jar</code>.
Be sure to use <code>javassist.jar</code> in the command line as shown above. You can find 
the location of this directory in jEdit by going to Utilities - Settings Directory,
so, for example, on my Linux system, this directory would be
<p>
<code>/home/danson/.jedit/jars</code>
<p>
You may want to include other options when you start jEdit, for example, here 
is the script I use:
<p>
<code>
#!/bin/sh<br/>
export JEDIT_HOME=/home/danson/apps/jedit/current<br/>
export JEDIT_JARS=/home/danson/.jedit/jars<br/>
<br/>
# Antialias fonts everywhere possible.<br/>
ANTIALIAS_ALL="-Dawt.useSystemAAFontSettings=on -Dswing.aatext=true"<br/>
<br/>
# no beeps<br/>
java -javaagent:$JEDIT_JARS/javassist.jar -Xmx620m -Xms512m ${ANTIALIAS_ALL} "-Djedit.home=$JEDIT_HOME" -jar "$JEDIT_HOME/jedit.jar" -reuseview "$@"<br/>
</code>
<p>
To actually turn on or off the beeps, you can use the Javassist plugin options 
or the LookAndFeel options and
check "Allow system beeps" or use the Console plugin with the Beanshell shell
and enter 
<p>
<code>System.setProperty("allowBeep", "false");</code> (or "true")
<p>
or you can enter the property on the command line like this:
<p>
<code>java -javaagent:/path/to/javassist.jar -DallowBeep=false -jar /path/to/jedit.jar</code>
<p>
Some important notes:
<ul>
<li>Keep in mind that it doesn't matter if this property is set or not if the javassist.jar
is not loaded as a java agent on the command line.</li>
<li>Note that many plugins still use <code>Toolkit.getDefaultToolkit().beep()</code>.
As I find these, I will either fix them, submit a patch, or enter a bug report 
for this noise code to be removed.</li>
<li>This plugin may have been released before jEdit itself has been fixed to use
UIManager.getLookAndFeel().provideErrorFeedback()</li>
</ul>
