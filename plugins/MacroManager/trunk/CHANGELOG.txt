ChangeLog for MacroManager plugin
=================================

VERSION 1.3
- can now handle archived/compressed downloads (gzip, tar and zip)
- new dependencies on tar.jar and activation.jar
- fixed bug that caused NullPointerExceptions on searches
- allow the dialog to set it's own size (scrollpanel looks nicer this way)
- added "sort by category", though some macros aren't categorized in the xml,
  so they aren't shown in this view
- added "Macro popup" action to allow users to search through and run macros
  (gui adapted from popup in OpenIt plugin)
- fixed bug where searching with macros selected would just install those macros

VERSION 1.2
- show number of downloads in dialog
- save macros based on the name attribute, rather than url
- allow saves to custom directories

VERSION 1.1
- searches now look for words individually (logical AND) rather than as a phrase
- macro list cached, refresh button added to GUI

VERSION 1.0

* Initial release
