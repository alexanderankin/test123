<!-- TITLE -->
<H1>GfxView plugin</H1>

<!-- AUTHOR -->
<H3>Author and facts</H3>
<P>This jEdit plugin is coded by Ludovic ANCIAUX (Ludovic.Anciaux@advalvas.be) and  
based on QuickNotePad "learning principles" plugin by Slava Pestov (http://www.jedit.org).</P>

<!-- PURPOSE AND MAIN DOCS -->
<H2>Purpose :  a basic viewing picture area</H2>
<P>There are a plugin menu, a FileSystemBrowser support and two panels :
<ul>
<li>Plugin menu functions are showing history panel, getting next and previous picture from history and showing a remote picture file from internet/intranet.</li>
<li>One can display a file in FileSystemBrowser (through VFS plugin menu)</li>
<li>An history panel that shows history list of latest additions (20 by default).</li>
<li>A display panel that shows picture choosen from history panel or dialog boxes. This panel has 3 buttons for zooming, 
unzooming and restoring original size. User has the possibility to draw a zoom
window while maintening CTRL key pressed. While Ctrl+Click increases zoom level, Ctrl+Shift+Click decreases it.</li>
</ul></P>

<!-- LIMITATIONS -->
<H3>Limitations</H3>
<ul>
<li>It shows only files formats recognized by <a href="http://reader.imagero.com/">ImageroReader library</a> (JPG/PNG/TIF/BMP). Previously it only supported Java JRE native formats (PNG/JPG).</li>
<li>Loading files from HTTP queries is rather basic</li>
</ul>

<!-- TO DO -->
<H3>To do</H3>
<ol>
<li>Do generic check such as added files/url are valid before inserting them in 
	history. If one history link becomes invalid, warn user and remove it.</li>
<li>Integrate more jEdit features
	<ul>  
		<li>Make it fully jEdit 4.1 &amp; 4.2 API at first release only</li>
		<li>Create a BeanShell macro that build an List of files such a way one can choose from it
			<ul>
				<li>e.g. PAxxxx or Tyyyy (NC programming)</li>
			</ul></li>
	</ul></li>
<li>Fix all bugs lying in sources ...</li>
<li>Implement better HTTP support with more useful dialog box (historyTextField ?).</li>
<li>Make code strong and efficient (PMD, JUnit, etc.)</li>
<li>Support other files formats (when everything else would have been done)
	<ul>
		<li>Many formats using Sun new Image Library (JARS weight is heavy)</li>
		<li>SVG using Apache/BATIK (JARS weight is heavy)</li>
		<li>Native HP-GL/2 against HPGL=>SVG (GNU HP2XX)</li>
	</ul></li>
</ol>
