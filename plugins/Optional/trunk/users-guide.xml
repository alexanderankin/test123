 <para>
  This plugin replaces the three Option dialogs in jedit  core: Global Options, Plugin Options and Buffer Options.
  Now you can access all of them from any of them, since they are available as different tabs under the same Dialog.

 Just install it and you'll notice the difference immediately.  The "help"
 action has been remapped via the <literal>actions.xml</literal> file, to pop
 up a combined dialog which features all of the options under one roof. I found
 I was frequently switching between global/plugin options, so I wanted to make
 that easier. Adding buffer options seemed like the next logical step.
