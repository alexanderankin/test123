Optional 0.1

Requirements:
	* jdk 1.4.1
	* jEdit 4.3pre3 

Announcement:
	release 0.1

Source:
	cvs.sourceforge.net: jedit/plugins/Optional

Short Description:
	A replacement for the three Option dialogs.

Long Description:
	 When you select Global, Plugin or Buffer options, you (should) see the same options in the
dialog as before, but this plugin gives you tabs to switch/navigate/edit/view any other settings
panel without closing the dialog. 

It uses a new feature of jEdit 4.3pre3 - the ability to override actions
via the actions.xml. A recent change to the way that ActionContext adds and removes
the actions from plugins makes it possible for plugins to override the 
built-in jEdit actions.
