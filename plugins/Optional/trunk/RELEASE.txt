Short Description:
	A replacement for the three Option dialogs.

Long Description:
	 When you select Global, Plugin or Buffer options, you (should) see the same options in the
dialog as before, but this plugin gives you tabs to switch/navigate/edit/view any other settings
panel without closing the dialog.

It uses a new feature of jEdit 4.3pre3 - the ability to override actions
via the actions.xml. A recent change to the way that ActionContext adds and removes
the actions from plugins makes it possible for plugins to override the
built-in jEdit actions.

History:

0.1		Initial Release
0.2.1	Updated for 4.3pre6 encoding options pane
0.2.2	Removed redundant buffer options pane
1.0     Bug fixes, "Combined Options" remembers previous selected tab.
1.0.1   Updated for jEdit 4.3pre17.
        Fixed # 3013717 - don't save optionpanes unless they are shown.
1.0.2	Optional no longer hardcodes the list of options panes to create, so core
        can add new ones without them being hidden by Optional (Matthieu Casanova)
