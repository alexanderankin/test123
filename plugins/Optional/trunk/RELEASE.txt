Announcement:
    Optional, release 0.2.4

Requirements:
	* jdk 1.5
	* jEdit 4.3pre12

Short Description:
	A replacement for the three Option dialogs.

Long Description:
	 When you select Global, Plugin or Buffer options, you (should) see the same options in the
dialog as before, but this plugin gives you tabs to switch/navigate/edit/view any other settings
panel without closing the dialog.

It uses a new feature of jEdit 4.3pre3 - the ability to override actions
via the actions.xml. A recent change to the way that ActionContext adds and removes
the actions from plugins makes it possible for plugins to override the
built-in jEdit actions.
