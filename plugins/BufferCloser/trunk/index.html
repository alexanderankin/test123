<h1> jEdit BufferCloser Plugin </h1>
<h2> Alan Ezust, alan dot ezust at gmail dot com </h2>

<p> When this plugin is enabled, you should notice that buffers open in other
non-Global buffersets will be automatically closed whenever you open them in
your active EditPane. This plugin is only useful for people who have multiple views,
and multiple editpanes, and wish to keep the number of buffers in each bufferset
down to a minimum. </p>
