   <h2>Antlr SideKick Plugin</h2>
   <h3>Dale Anson</h3>
   <p>ANTLR (ANother Tool for Language Recognition) is a powerful parser generator 
   for reading, processing, executing, or translating structured text or binary files. 
   It's widely used to build languages, tools, and frameworks. From a grammar, ANTLR 
   generates a parser that can build and walk parse trees.</p>
	<p>This plugin provides a SideKick to make working with ANTLR grammar files easier.</p>
	<p>There is one action provided, "Generate files". If the current buffer contains an
	Antlr 4 grammar file, executing this action will generate the Antlr lexer, parser, 
	etc, files into the same directory.</p>
	
	<h3>Change log:</h3>
	<ul>
	   <li>10 Jun 2022, Version 4.10, updated to use Antlr 4.10 (see Antlr library plugin). The
	   grammar to parse antlr files with antlr hasn't changed, but the parser generated by the
	   old version of Antlr is not compatible with the new version.</li>
	   <li>4 Dec 2015, Version 4.5.1, updated to use new optimized version of Antlr 4.5.1.</li>
	   <li>16 Dec 2014, Version 4.0, initial release.</li>
	</ul>
