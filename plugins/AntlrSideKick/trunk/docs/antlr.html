   <h2>Antlr SideKick Plugin</h2>
   <p>ANTLR (ANother Tool for Language Recognition) is a powerful parser generator 
   for reading, processing, executing, or translating structured text or binary files. 
   It's widely used to build languages, tools, and frameworks. From a grammar, ANTLR 
   generates a parser that can build and walk parse trees.</p>
	<p>This plugin provides a SideKick to make working with ANTLR grammar files easier.</p>
