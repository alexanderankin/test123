This plugin provides the FlatLaf look and feel to jEdit.
<p>
FlatLaf is a modern open-source cross-platform Look and Feel for Java Swing desktop applications.
<p>
It looks almost flat (no shadows or gradients), clean, simple and elegant. FlatLaf comes with Light, Dark, IntelliJ and Darcula themes, scales on HiDPI displays and runs on Java 8 or newer.
<p>
The look is heavily inspired by Darcula and IntelliJ themes from IntelliJ IDEA 2019.2+ and uses almost the same colors and icons.
