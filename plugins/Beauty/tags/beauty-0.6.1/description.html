The Beauty plugin is a general
framework for code beautifiers and provides several
built-in beautifiers. While there are several existing
plugins for beautifying/formatting various source file
formats, this plugin aims to consolidate those
formatters into a standard API so that beautifying can
be performed in a general way, similar to how the
SideKick plugin provides a general framework for code
browsers.
