      The Beauty plugin is a general framework for code beautifiers and provides several built-in beautifiers. While
      there are several existing plugins for beautifying/formatting various source file formats, this plugin aims to
      consolidate those formatters into a standard API so that beautifying can be performed in a general way, similar
      to how the SideKick plugin provides a general framework for code browsers.
      <p>
      In this first release, there are 4 beautifiers/formatters included:
      <ul>
         <li>HTML: works very well.
         <li>
         JSP: works very well.
         <li>Java: works well, formats strictly to Sun's formatting standard only. Needs work on doing line wrapping
         per Sun's guidelines.
         <li>
         JavaCC: works well, formats to a combination of Sun's Java formatting standard and my own style for javacc
         files.
      </ul>
      <p>
      Two other plugins have been updated to support the Beauty framework:
      <ul>
         <li>AStyle: a nice, configurable beautifier for Java, C, and C++ code.
         <li>XmlIndenter: part of the XML plugin, this beautifier works on all xml-based
         files.  Use this for well-formed xml dialects like docbook files, Ant files, and
         so on, use the HTML beautifier for those xml-like files that are not necessarily
         well-formed.
      </ul>
      <p>
      All other modes can default to use the built-in jEdit indenter, which works pretty well for most modes.  To
      turn on this option, check the box in the Beauty options.
      <p>
      Beauty also provides a way to <a href="#custom">configure a custom beautifier</a> per mode.
      <p>
      <table summary="Configuration" border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=3 width="100%">
         <tr align=CENTER width="100%">
            <td bgcolor="#7FB2FF" width="100%">
               <strong><font color="#FFFFFF" size="+1"><a name="config">Configuration</a></font></strong>
            </td>
         </tr>
      </table>
      <p>
      At the moment, the only configuration is by the settings for the buffer and/or mode. If you're editing an html
      file in html mode, then the html beautifier will be used to format the file. The settings are controlled by the
      settings for the buffer and the mode:
      <p>
      <ul>
         <li>Line separators: as set for the current buffer.
         <li>Tab width: as set for the current buffer.
         <li>Indent width: as set for the current buffer.
         <li>Soft tabs: in this initial release, all tabs are converted to soft tabs. This should be fixed in the next
         release to honor the soft tab setting for the buffer.
      </ul>
      <p>
      To set which beautifier to use per mode, use the Beauty option settings under the Plugins - Plugin Options menu.
      <p>
      <table summary="Custom Beautifier" border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=3 width="100%">
         <tr align=CENTER width="100%">
            <td bgcolor="#7FB2FF" width="100%">
               <strong><font color="#FFFFFF" size="+1"><a name="custom">Custom Beautifier</a></font></strong>
            </td>
         </tr>
      </table>
      <p>
      <i>Custom beautifiers can be shared.  If you create one for a mode, post it on the jEdit mailing lists or add it to
      the jEdit plugin feature tracker, and I'll include it in the next release of Beauty.</i>
      <p>
      To set up a custom beautifier:
      <ol>
      <li>Go to Plugins - Plugin Options - Beauty - Custom Beautifier</li>
      <li>Select the mode to configure</li>
      <li>Configure the beautifier</li>
      <li>Go to Plugins - Plugin Options - Beauty - Modes and assign your newly created beautifier.  You can assign the same
      beautifier to more than one mode, so you could create a beautifier for pl-sql and assign the same beautifier to both
      the sql-loader mode and the transact-sql mode.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
      The configuration should need only a little explanation.
      <p>
      This beautifier works by using jEdit syntax highlighting engine
      to tokenize the buffer, so the same tokens that are identified by the syntax highlighting are used by the
      custom beautifier.  For example, "+" may be defined in the mode file as an operator.  Checking the "before"
      and "after" for "Pad operators" will cause the beautifier to make sure that there is a space before and
      after all "+" characters.  Functions, digits, operators, and keywords are defined in the mode file, so the
      quality of this tokenization really depends on the quality of the mode file.
      <p>
      Labels are also defined in the mode file, and you may want to put labels on a separate line.  This may or may not 
      work well, again, it depends on the quality of 
      the mode file.  For example, in the Ada language, a label is defined as <tt>&lt;&lt;</tt>sometext<tt>&gt;&gt;</tt>, 
      but in the Ada mode file, both <tt>&lt;&lt;</tt> and <tt>&gt;&gt;</tt> are defined as labels.  This means that 
      if you elect to put a label on a separate line, you'll end up with
      <br>
      <pre>
      &lt;&lt;sometext
      &gt;&gt;
      </pre>
      <br>
      In this case, either the mode file needs to be fixed, or use the "Insert line separator before" and "Insert
      line separators after" text fields, and enter <tt>&lt;&lt;</tt> in the before and <tt>&gt;&gt;</tt> in the after.
      <p>
      The "Insert line separators before" and "Insert line separators after" text fields can take a comma separated
      list of strings.  Do not put spaces in this string unless you really mean it.  Regular expressions can be used,
      but note that this is a comma separated list, so if your regex contains commas, things probably won't work as
      you'd want.
      <p>
      You can also specify lists of characters that should have a space before or after.  For example, you may want
      a space following each <tt>(</tt> and before each <tt>)</tt>.
      <p>
      Further, you can specify lists of characters that should not have a space before or after.  This is handy for
      modes like javascript that define ".", ",", and ";" as operators.  Adding these characters to the don't pad
      text fields will cause the beautifier to remove spaces before and after these characters even though they may
      be padded as operators.
      <p>
      You can elect to have multiple blank lines collapsed into a single blank line.
      <p>
      Last, you can have the custom beautifier use the jEdit indenter to do the line indentation.  Again, the jEdit 
      indenter works based on the mode definition file, so how well the indenting works depends on the quality of the
      mode file.
      <p>
      The custom beautifier applies the configuration in order from top to bottom, so, for example, operators are 
      padded before applying the 'don't pad before' configuration.  Padding is only applied if there is no whitespace
      before or after the item to be padded, so additional whitespace is not added unnecessarily.

      Adding a new beautifier/formatter is quite simple:
      <ol>
         <li>Write a formatter that implements beauty.beautifiers.Beautifier. You'll need to implement only the <code>
         String beautify(String text)</code> method. Your formatter will be passed the complete contents of a buffer in
         the <code>text</code> parameter, and should return formatted text. The buffer contents will be replaced with
         this returned text.
         <li>Create a simple plugin that contains this formatter.
         <li>Add a <code>services.xml</code> file to your plugin like this:
         <p>
         <code>
         &lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;
         <br>
         &lt;!DOCTYPE SERVICES SYSTEM "services.dtd"&gt;
         <br>
         <br>
         &lt;SERVICES&gt;
         <br>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;SERVICE CLASS="beauty.beautifiers.Beautifier" NAME="lispy"&gt;
         <br>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;new lisp.lispy.Beautify();
         <br>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/SERVICE&gt;
         <br>
         &lt;/SERVICES&gt; </code>
         <p>
         For <code>NAME</code> , either use the name of the editing mode that the beautifier supports, or a unique name
         for your plugin. The beanshell code must return an object that can be cast to <code>
         beauty.beautifiers.Beautifier</code> .
         <li>For each editing mode that your beautifier supports, add a line to your plugin properties file like this:
         <p>
         mode.MODENAME.beauty.beautifier.NAME
         <p>
         where <code>MODENAME</code> is the name of an editing mode that your beautifier supports, and <code>NAME</code>
         is the same name used in the services.xml file. So continuing the example, you might have:
         <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>mode.lisp.beauty.beautifiers.lispy</code>
         <p>
         for your beautifier that supports the Lisp language.
         <li>Release your plugin.
      </ol>
