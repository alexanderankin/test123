    This is an example build file to run unit tests.  This is the build file for
    the unit tests for the SVN plugin.  It has comments to describe all the
    necessary settings for getting unit tests to run.
    
    The SVNPlugin source directory looks like this:
    SVNPlugin
    |
    +- lib
    +- src
    +- test
       |
       -- build.xml (this file)
       +- test (holds the source code for the unit tests)
       +- test_reports (holds the output from JUnit)
       
    It is assumed that the plugin is already built and deployed to the standard
    ${install.dir} as is typical for plugins.  If the plugin is actually built
    to some other directory, you'll need to change the directory for the 
    'plugin.jars' file list below.
    
    There is no assumption made about the location of the test framework itself.
    I have it installed in a directory at the same level as jEdit:
    
    /home/danson/src
    |
    +- jEdit
    +- jEditTestFramework
    +- plugins
       |
       -- build.properties
       +- build-support
       +- ...
       +- SVNPlugin 
       
    The location of the test framework directory should be set in a property 
    file.  A good place to set this property is in the same build.properties
    used in general for plugin builds.
    
    -----
    Runs junit tests on the plugin.  Assumes a normal build of the plugin
    has already happened and been deployed to the standard ${install.dir}.  The
    test framework assumes the jEdit source is installed.  It will do a clean
    build of jEdit and use the resulting build directory as the jEdit settings
    directory and the jEdit installation.  Jars required by the plugin are
    specified in the plugin.jars filelist and will be copied into the jEdit
    build directory in a jars subdirectory.
