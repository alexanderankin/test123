This plugin provides a dockable browser provided by the native, SWT-based,
Swing libraries from the DJ Project (http://djproject.sourceforge.net/).
It is not meant to replace a full browser but it does offer the advantage
of a richer browsing supporting javascript, flash, and easy rendering of
the current buffer in one-click. In fact, the main motivation for this
plugin is to easily test HTML/js/flash content without leaving jEdit.

Because this plugin uses native SWT libraries which perform callback to
the java application, some jars need to be installed as part of jEdit's
system classpath (the one used by the system class loader). As a result
this plugin requires some manual installation steps as detailed in its
documentation file.
