        <para>This plugin provides a dockable browser provided by the native,
        SWT-based, Swing libraries from the
        <ulink url="http://djproject.sourceforge.net/">DJ Project</ulink>.
        It is not meant to replace a full browser but it does offer the advantage
        of a richer browsing supporting javascript, flash, and easy rendering of
        the current buffer in one-click. In fact, the main motivation for this
        plugin is to easily test HTML/js/flash content without leaving jEdit.</para>
        <para>Because this plugin uses native SWT libraries which perform
        callback to the java application, some jars need to be installed as part of
        jEdit's system classpath (the one used by the system class loader).
        As a result this plugin requires some manual installation steps
        as detailed below.</para>

        <title>Manual Installation Steps!!!</title>

        </indexterm>
        
        <para>NativeBrowser requires the following jars to be loaded by
        the system class loader. In other words these jars need to be put
        in jEdit's classpath:</para>
        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
                <para><filename>DJNativeSwing.jar</filename> and <filename>DJNativeSwing-SWT.jar</filename>:
                These are part of <ulink url="http://djproject.sourceforge.net/">DJ Native Swing</ulink></para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para><filename>jna.jar</filename> renamed to <filename>jna-3.2.4.jar</filename>:
                This jar can be found on the
                <ulink url="http://jna.dev.java.net/">Java Native Access website</ulink>.
                Because the SVNPlugin currently uses an older version of this jar,
                NativeBrowser plugin requires this jar to be renamed to
                <filename>jna-3.2.4.jar</filename> (3.2.4 is the latest version of JNA
                at the time of writing, but the jar can be of any version as long as the
                name is <filename>jna-3.2.4.jar</filename>).</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para><filename>swt.jar</filename>: This jar is specific to each platform and
                can be downloaded on the <ulink url="http://www.eclipse.org/swt/">Eclipse SWT page</ulink></para>
            </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
        <para>All these jars except the last one are included in the distribution zip file.
        Therefore upon installing the NativeBrowser plugin they are automatically placed
        in the the <filename>/jars</filename> subdirectory of your user settings directory
        (which you can find by evaluating the BeanShell expression
        <userinput>jEdit.getSettingsDirectory()</userinput>).
        The last jar <filename>swt.jar</filename> needs to be downloaded manually and
        placed in that same directory because each platform needs its own version.</para>
        <para>With these jars in place jEdit is able to load the NativeBrower plugin without
        complaining about a missing jar. However jEdit won't be able to open the
        NativeBrowser window until these jars are also placed jEdit's classpath.</para>
        <para>The easiest was is to modify the <varname>CLASSPATH</varname> environment variable
        to include each one of the 4 jars above. For example on Linux one can modify the
        <filename>/usr/bin/jedit</filename> script to include:</para>
<para><varname>&nbsp;&nbsp;JEJARS=~/.jedit/jars</varname></para>
<para><varname>&nbsp;&nbsp;JECP=$JEJARS/swt.jar:$JEJARS/DJNativeSwing.jar:$JEJARS/DJNativeSwing-SWT.jar:$JEJARS/jna-3.2.4.jar</varname></para>
<para><varname>&nbsp;&nbsp;if [ "$CLASSPATH" = "" ]; then</varname></para>
<para><varname>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CLASSPATH="/usr/share/java/jedit/jedit.jar":$JECP</varname></para>
<para><varname>&nbsp;&nbsp;else</varname></para>
<para><varname>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CLASSPATH="/usr/share/java/jedit/jedit.jar":$JECP:$CLASSPATH</varname></para>
<para><varname>&nbsp;&nbsp;fi</varname></para>
        <para>Eventually the burden of adding jars to jEdit's classpath should
        become a responsibility the plugin framework. Until then such manual steps
        will be required for libraries needing native callback to java.</para>

        <title>Controls</title>

        <para>The toolbar above the browser component area provides the following controls:</para>

        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
                <para><guilabel>Menu Bar</guilabel> - this checkbox
                controls the display of the browser menu bar which contains
                several additional commands such as opening a file, displaying
                a status bar, etc.</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
                <para><guilabel>Home page</guilabel> - this button
                causes NativeBrowser to load the home page as specified in
                NativeBrowser options.</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
                <para><guilabel>Render current buffer</guilabel> - this button
                causes NativeBrowser to load the contents from the current buffer
				(which must be HTML).</para>
            </listitem>

        </itemizedlist>

        <para>More operations are listed in the submenu which appears for
        NativeBrowser under the <guimenu>Plugins</guimenu> menu. These can also
        be made the subject of keyboard shortcuts in the <guilabel>Shortcuts</guilabel>
        pane of the <guimenu>Utilities>Global Options...</guimenu> menu.</para>
        
        <para>If the Launcher plugin is installed some operations will also appear
        in the contextual menu of File Browser, ProjectViewer, and text area. 
        </para>

	        <secondary>platform</secondary>
        </indexterm>
        
        
        <para>NativeBrowser uses the
        <ulink url="http://djproject.sourceforge.net/">DJ Project</ulink>
        native Swing libraries based on <ulink url="http://www.eclipse.org/swt/">SWT</ulink>.
        Therefore this plugin can only work on platforms where these libraries are supported.
        At the time of writing this include Windows and Linux platforms while
        MacOS X support is still in development, more info on the 
        <ulink url="http://sourceforge.net/projects/djproject/forums/forum/671154/topic/3353840">
        DJ Project forum</ulink>.</para>
        <para>Although NativeBrowser and DJ Native Swing libraries require Java 1.5 minimum,
        running them with java 1.6 may offer increased stability on some systems.</para>
        <para>The author of this plugin does not have access to a Mac, so if you have
        one and feel like experimenting, you probably will need to replace the
        following libraries with their latest/development versions:
