TODO:

for 0.9.3:

- include some sample jython macros in the JAR, and on first use of the
  plugin or invocation of plugins-jython-reinstall sample macros, copy
  them to ~/.jedit/jython
- update docs

Bugs:
	- Prompt should be defined by sys.ps1, sys.ps2
	- look into Reinout's class path problems
	- do path mods work?

Whishes:
- Class browser
	- Fix to add modules
	- Fix to add jar/zip files

	- Run buffer and reuse
	- Clean session
	- Run and profile (version 0,7)
- Options
	- Base colors
	- Base font
- Error handling:
	- Connect to ErrorList (ErrorList does not support multiline errors)

	- Delete works on selections too
	- Home works in every line
	- solved bugs when history is empty
	- Error button kumps to the right line
	- Fixed focus going to the wrong place for non-docked widnows
