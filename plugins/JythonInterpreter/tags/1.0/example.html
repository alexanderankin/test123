<h1>Macro Example</h1>

<h2>General</h2>
</a>
<p>Macros written in jython/python can be run into jEdit quite easily in two
ways
<OL>
	<LI>By calling them into the interpreter by the funciton
	_execMacro("name.py"). The name has to correspond to a file stored either in
	<ul>
	<li>[jEdit user's home dir]\jython, or
	<li>[jEdit home dir]\jython
	</ul>
	<LI>By calling them from the BeanShell creating a macro which calls
		<p> jython.JythonExecutor.execMacro("name.py") that behaves exactly as the
		former
</OL>

<h2>Example</h2>
<p>This example loads a web page via the Internet and puts its source on a jEdit
buffer. It pops-up a dialog requiesting the address, it parses it and loads it on
to a new buffer. It requires the standard libraries for jython.

<p>Files:
<ul>
<li><A href="Load_Web_Page.bsh">BeanShell macro:</A>
copy it to your preferred macro directory. It is a stanard macro which executes
jython.JythonExecutor.execFile("load_web_page.py");
<li><A href="load_web_page.py">Python macro:</A> copy it to the jython\macro
directory. It does the actual work
</ul>
