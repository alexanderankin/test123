<h1> Rename Plugin </h1>
<h3> Brad Mace </h3>

<p> This plugin allows you to rename plugins, actions, dockables and option panes in jEdit. 
This helps you if you find yourself short on screen space, or wish to translate words into your native language to help you remember them better. </p>

<p> There are no actions or dockables for this plugin. Everything that can be done with this plugin is exposed from the <b>Plugin Options - Rename</b> option pane.
