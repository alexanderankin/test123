<h1> Rename Plugin </h1>
<h3> Brad Mace </h3>

<p> This plugin allows you to rename plugins, actions, dockables and option
panes in jEdit.  This helps you if you find yourself short on screen space,
or wish to translate words into your native language to help you remember
them better. </p>

<p> There are no actions or dockables for this plugin. Everything that can
be done with this plugin is exposed from the <b>Plugin Options - Rename</b>
option pane.  </p>

<p> One interesting side-effect of this plugin is that it makes permanent
changes to the labels in the user's <tt>properties</tt> file. Even after
uninstalling the plugin, the renamed things remain. </p>
