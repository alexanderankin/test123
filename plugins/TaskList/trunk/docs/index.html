<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
TaskList searches through your files for "to do" items and presents those in a 
clickable tree format for easy access. 

<p>This plugin provides a dockable list of comments extracted from
the comments (or all text) in a file being edited in jEdit. The display shows an icon
representing the type of comment, the line where the comment appears and
the comment text. You can jump to a comment by double-clicking on the
corresponding row of the table. The comment text in the buffer can be
highlighted as a user option.<p>
<p>
By default, TaskList uses the mode of the file to find comments.  Some modes do not designate comments, such as
'text' mode and 'hex' mode.  These two modes are not parsed for comments.  As edit modes are regularly 
added to jEdit, there may be other modes that do not contain comments, so no tasks will be shown for
those modes. 
<p>
It is possible for TaskList to parse complete files rather than just comments. This 
may be somewhat slower, but does allow for the possibility of finding tasks in text 
and hex files. This setting is done per mode, so, for example, TaskList can be set to look
for tasks in the comments in C files, look in the entire file for text files, and
skip hex files altogether. This makes it possible for TaskList to be used as a
sort of document outliner. For example, you could have tasks set up for the &lt;h1&gt;, &lt;h2&gt;,
&lt;h3&gt;, &lt;h4&gt;, and &lt;h5&gt; tags in html files, set TaskList to parse
the complete file (rather than just comments) in html files, and then TaskList will
present a decent outline of your html files.
<p>
In general, binary files are not parsed for comments. TaskList uses an extensive
list of filename extensions to decide if a file is binary before opening it, which
greatly improves performance. However, it is impossible to determine binary files
by name alone, so the once the file is opened, it is scanned for binary content.
If it is determined that the file is indeed binary, it will not be parsed for tasks.
Unfortunately, the mere act of opening a binary file in jEdit can cause jEdit to
display messages about encoding errors. 
<p>
The types of files that are considered binary are configurable in the plugin 
options.

<h2>Default Tags</h2>
<p>A number of default comment tags are supplied, each with a 
distinctive icon:
<p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="3">

</tbody>
</table>
<p>You can change the icons associated with a task type by changing the
plugin's settings in the <code>Plugins</code> -&gt; <code>Plugin Options</code> -&gt; <code>TaskList</code> -&gt; <code>Task Types</code> dialog. You can
also add your own comment types, using the icons supplied with the
plugin or your own custom icons.<p>
<a name="examples"></a>
<h2>Examples</h2>
<p>TODO in a Java comment:<p><programlisting>
// TODO: add some more comments</programlisting>
<p>NOTE in an HTML comment:<p><programlisting>
&lt;!--
 NOTE: there must be at least one space character before ``NOTE``.
--&gt;</programlisting>

<a name="operation"></a>
<h2>Operation</h2>
<p>Whenever the plugin is activated, it will parse a buffer and display
formatted comments when the buffer is first loaded, when it is saved,
and when you switch buffers or edit panes within a view window. To jump
to the text of a comment in the buffer, double-click on the row
containing the comment.<p>

<p>You can change or delete a comment by right-clicking on a row containing
a comment. A popup menu will appear with three selections, <code>Change task
tag</code>, <code>Delete task</code>, <code>Parse buffer</code>,
 <code>Parse All</code>, <code>Sort By</code>, and <code>Sort Direction</code>.<p>
 
<p>You can change the type of comment (for example, from <code>IDEA</code> to
<code>TODO</code>, or from <code>TODO</code> to <code>DONE</code>, by selecting the <code>Change task
tag</code> option. A child popup menu will appear with the text of available
comment tags. Clicking on an item will cause the buffer text to be
updated to show the new comment tag. The TaskList display will also be
updated.<p>

<p>You can delete a task comment by selecting <code>Delete task</code> from the popup
menu. You then have the choice between deleting the comment tag only (so
the comment text will remain but will not be parsed as a task comment)
and deleting the entire comment. This operation will also refresh the
TaskList display.<p>

<p>Any change or deletion to a task comment in a text buffer can be
reversed using the editor's <code>Undo</code> feature.<p>

<p>The TaskList display is not refreshed with every change made to a
buffer. It is updated when a buffer is loaded or saved, when you switch
edit panes or buffers in the view window and when you make changes to a
task comment using the plugin context (right-click) menu. As a result,
if you have made unsaved changes to a buffer, TaskList may not be able
to find or change your comment text. You can reparse a buffer at any
time using the <code>Task List</code> -&gt; <code>Parse buffer</code> menu item in the <code>Plugins</code>
menu (which you can tie to a keyboard shortcut), or by using the "Refresh" button in the TaskList dockable.<p>

<p>
TaskList will also display a list of all tasks in all open files.  This tab can be turned off in the plugin options.
<p>

<h2>Project Viewer Integration</h2>
<p>
If the ProjectViewer plugin is installed, TaskList can find all tasks in
the current project.  For large projects, this can take a long time.
<p>
You can turn off parsing of all projects by unchecking the box in the TaskList
options, General, "Show tasks for all project files".
<p>
You can also turn off parsing of a single project in the ProjectViewer
properties for the project.
<p>
<img src="pv_options.jpg">

<p>
You can also find the tasks in just part of a project by right clicking on a 
file or directory in Project Viewer and selecting "Find Tasks" from the popup 
menu.  This can be more useful in large projects.  A new tab will be opened 
for each such action.  These tabs can be closed individually when they are 
no longer needed.
<p>

<h2>File Browser Integration</h2>
<p>
You can also find tasks using the File System Browser by right clicking on a 
file or directory and selecting "Find Tasks" from the plugins menu.   A new 
tab will be opened for each such action.  These tabs can be closed individually 
when they are no longer needed.
<p>

<p>
The TaskList dockable provides a "Filter" menu that lets you show or hide certain types of tasks.  The Filter menu also contains a "Toggle All" item, which makes it easier to select specific types.
<p>


<a name="settings-and-options"></a>
<h2>Settings and Options</h2>
<p>There are three option pane windows available for user settings from the
<code>Plugins</code> -&gt; <code>Plugin Options</code> -&gt; <code>TaskList</code> dialog.<p><a name="general"></a>
<h2>General</h2>
<p>The <code>General</code> options pane allows you to change the appearance of the
TaskList table display, including default sorting criteria, and
highlighting of commented buffer text.<p>

<img src="general_options.jpg">

<p>
Most of these should be self-explanatory. 
<ul>
<li>"Show tasks for all project files" must be checked for the "Project" tab
to be visible, regardless of whether the "Automatically scan for tasks when project opens"
is set in the Project Viewer options.
</ul>
<p>

<a name="task-types"></a>
<h2>Task Types</h2>
<p>The <code>Task Types</code> options pane allows you to add, delete, or edit comment
tags corresponding to task types.<p>

<p>The tags for default task types, and any types you may add, are
represented by regular expressions for which the TaskList plugin
searches once it encounters a comment token on a line of buffer text.
The content of the comment token will depend on the jEdit edit mode
being applied to the buffer. The regular expression is applied to all
text on a given line following the matching comment. Two fields are
extracted for display when a match occurs: the name of the tag that will
be displayed at the beginning of the <code>Description</code> column of the
TaskList table, and the text of the comment that will follow the tag
name. These two fields correspond to two defined groups in the tag's
regular expression.<p>

<p>The ability to change the comment type and tag from the TaskList table
(using its context menu) depends upon the target comment type's regular
expression being in the basic form of the default types:<p>
<code>
\s+(task-type-name):\s+(comment-text)$
</code>
<p>
It is expected that the regular expression contains two groups.  The first is the task type name, the second is the task comment.  Regular expression groups are not technically required, but it is best practice to do so.  If there are no groups or only one group defined, then the entire match will be considered to be the task type name.
<p>
Here are some examples to help you write your own task types:
<code>\s(TODO)[:]?\s+(.+)$</code><br>
This will match lines like:
<ul>
	<li>// TODO: clean this up</li>
	<li>// TODO add documentation for this function</li>
</ul>
Notice that these regular expressions do contain two groups, as is recommended.  In this example, the regular expression requires that the task type name be preceded with and followed by whitespace.  This helps ensure that the task type name is not found inside another word.

<p>When using the current version, the name of the task type is the tag name used in regular expression.<p>

<p>You can reset the task patterns to those installed with the plugin by
using the <code>Task List</code> -&gt; <code>Reset task patterns</code> command.<p>
<a name="modes"></a>
<h2>Modes</h2>
<p>The <code>Modes</code> option pane allow you to specify which modes TaskList should
extract tasks from comments.<p>

<p>As <code>text</code> and <code>hex</code> don't have comments, they are not enabled by
default.<p>

<a name="known-bugs-and-limitations"></a>
<h2>Known bugs and limitations</h2>
<p>The name of a task item must currently be identical to the tag text
contained in the regular expression defining the task item. These items
may be corrected in a future version.<p>

<p>The current version also does not parse task comments spanning more than
one line of buffer text. There is also no facility for serializing the
contents of the TaskList display. These features may be added in a
future version.<p>
