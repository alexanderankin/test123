Summary
=======

This plugin provides a dockable tabular list of comments extracted from
the text of a file being edited in jEdit. The display shows an icon
representing the type of comment, the line where the comment appears and
the comment text. You can jump to a comment by double-clicking on the
corresponding row of the table. The comment text in the buffer can be
highlighted as a user option.

Default Tags
============

A number of default comment tags are supplied, each with a 
distinctive icon:

=========== ==================

DONE        |DONE_ICON|

You can change the icons associated with a task type by changing the
plugin's settings in the `Utilities` -> `Global Options` dialog. You can
also add your own comment types, using the icons supplied with the
plugin or your own custom icons.

Examples
========

TODO in a Java comment::

	// TODO: add some more comments

NOTE in an HTML comment::

	<!--
	 NOTE: there must be at least one space character before ``NOTE``.
	-->

Operation
=========

Whenever the plugin is activated, it will parse a buffer and display
formatted comments when the buffer is first loaded, when it is saved,
and when you switch buffers or edit panes within a view window. To jump
to the text of a comment in the buffer, double-click on the row
containing the comment.

By default, the task comments are sorted in ascending order by the line
of buffer text in which each comment appears. You can change the sorting
arrangement by double-clicking on the header above the column
corresponding to the sort criteria. Clicking on the icon or
`Description` column will trigger sorting by the comment tag (such as
``NOTE`` or ``QUESTION``), and by buffer line number within a group of
identically tagged comment. The text of the comment following the tag
will be ignored for sorting purposes. If the column being clicked
already corresponds to the existing sort criteria, the direction of the
sort is reversed - from ascending to descending, for example. A given
sorting arrangement changed in this fashion will persist as long as the
TaskList plugin is active.

You can change or delete a comment by right-clicking on a row containing
a comment. A popup menu will appear with three selections, `Change task
tag`, `Delete task`, and `Parse buffer`.

You can change the type of comment (for example, from ``IDEA`` to
``TODO``, or from ``TODO`` to ``DONE``, by selecting the `Change task
tag` option. A child popup menu will appear with the text of available
comment tags. Clicking on an item will cause the buffer text to be
updated to show the new comment tag. The TaskList display will also be
updated.

You can delete a task comment by selecting `Delete task` from the popup
menu. You then have the choice between deleting the comment tag only (so
the comment text will remain but will not be parsed as a task comment)
and deleting the entire comment. This operation will also refresh the
TaskList display.

Any change or deletion to a task comment in a text buffer can be
reversed using the editor's `Undo` feature.

The TaskList display is not refreshed with every change made to a
buffer. It is updated when a buffer is loaded or saved, when you switch
edit panes or buffers in the view window and when you make changes to a
task comment using the plugin context (right-click) menu. As a result,
if you have made unsaved changes to a buffer, TaskList may not be able
to find or change your comment text. You can reparse a buffer at any
time using the `Task List` -> `Parse buffer` menu item in the `Plugins`
menu (which you can tie to a keyboard shortcut) or by double-clicking on
the header row of the TaskList table.

Settings and Options
====================

There are three option pane windows available for user settings from the
`Utilities` -> `Global Options` dialog.

General
-------

The `General` options pane allows you to change the appearance of the
TaskList table display, including default sorting criteria, and
highlighting of commented buffer text.

Task Types
----------

The `Task Types` options pane allows you to add, delete, or edit comment
tags corresponding to task types.

The tags for default task types, and any types you may add, are
represented by regular expressions for which the TaskList plugin
searches once it encounters a comment token on a line of buffer text.
The content of the comment token will depend on the jEdit edit mode
being applied to the buffer. The regular expression is applied to all
text on a given line following the matching comment. Two fields are
extracted for display when a match occurs: the name of the tag that will
be displayed at the beginning of the `Description` column of the
TaskList table, and the text of the comment that will follow the tag
name. These two fields correspond to two defined groups in the tag's
regular expression.

The ability to change the comment type and tag from the TaskList table
(using its context menu) depends upon the target comment type's regular
expression being in the basic form of the default types::

    \s+(tag-name):\s+(.+)$

When using the current version, the name of the task type should match
the tag name used in regular expression.

You can reset the task patterns to those installed with the plugin by
using the `Task List` -> `Reset task patterns` command.


Modes
-----

The `Modes` option pane allow you to specify which modes TaskList should
extract tasks from comments.

As ``text`` and ``hex`` don't have comments, they are not enabled by
default.


Known bugs and limitations
==========================

The name of a task item must currently be identical to the tag text
contained in the regular expression defining the task item. These items
may be corrected in a future version.

The current version also does not parse task comments spanning more than
one line of buffer text. There is also no facility for serializing the
contents of the TaskList display. These features may be added in a
future version.
