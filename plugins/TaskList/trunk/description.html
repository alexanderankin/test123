The TaskList plugin finds all the "to do" items and presents them in a 
clickable tree format, which makes it easy to jump directly to those items. 
What counts as a "to do" item is highly customizable, so it is possible to 
have items as simple as "FIXME" and as complex as "Chapter 1, Section 1". 
It has the ability to parse entire files, so it can act as a document 
outliner similar to Sidekick. It is also very useful as a set of bookmarks 
in code and other documentation.
