This plugin provides a dockable tabular list of comments extracted from the text of a file being edited in jEdit. The display shows an icon representing the type of comment, the line where the comment appears and the comment text. You can jump to a comment by double-clicking on the corresponding row of the table. The comment text in the buffer can be highlighted as a user option.
