Short Description:
	A sidekick parser for Perl.

Long Description: 
    This sidekick plugin parses Perl source and analyzes
	it, using regular expressions (an excentric programming style will
	probably confuse the plugin).  For each package a tree branch is
	built. It shows package name, "used" and "required" modules and
	sub names.  Mind that the branches do not reflect the order of
	subs in the source code, but are sorted by package and sub
	names. Additionally all POD headlines are listed in their natural
	order.
