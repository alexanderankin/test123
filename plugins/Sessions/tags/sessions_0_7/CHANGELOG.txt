VERSION 0.7

- initial release, spinned off from the BufferList Plugin 0.6.3
- as a result of the spin off, the Session Switcher toolbar can no longer be
  docked into BufferList. I'm searching for a remedy, but in the meantime
  your only choice is to dock it into the view at top.
- bugfix: switching sessions could cause the line numbers in the gutter
  to vanish (SessionsPlugin no longer sends out PropertiesChanged messages
  on session change)
- requires jEdit 3.2pre2 or higher
