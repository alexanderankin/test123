VERSION 1.0.1

- new option to add the session toolbar at the top of the BufferList plugin
  (needs BufferList 0.8 or higher)
- fixed toolbar icons
- fixed #461523: Session files occasionally get corrupted
- requires jEdit 4.0 or higher


VERSION 1.0.0 (unreleased)

- introduced session local properties (experimental!)
- new "Edit Session Properties" dialog (experimental!)
- allow third parties to add custom session property option panes,
  and to listen for property changes
- every session has two default properties: "basedir" and "mode"
- session files are now in XML format (old session files are
  automatically converted to the new format on the next run)
- faster session switching
- some refactorings (now has a real "Session" class)
- Ant instead of JMK makefile
- requires jEdit 3.2.1


VERSION 0.7.3
- SVU: Fix the bug introduced in 0.7.2


VERSION 0.7.2
- SVU: Two messages are fired: before changing the session and after the
  sesion is changed


VERSION 0.7.1

- the sessions toolbar can now be added to jEdit's main toolbar; saves screenspace
- requires jEdit 3.2.1


VERSION 0.7

- initial release, spun off from the BufferList Plugin 0.6.3
- as a result of the spin off, the Session Switcher toolbar can no longer be
  docked into BufferList. I'm searching for a remedy, but in the meantime
  your only choice is to dock it into the view at top.
- bugfix: switching sessions could cause the line numbers in the gutter
  to vanish (SessionsPlugin no longer sends out PropertiesChanged messages
  on session change)
- requires jEdit 3.2pre2 or higher
