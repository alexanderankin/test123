VERSION 1.4.3 (Steve Jakob)
- incorporated code submitted by halyavin (patch #2006663) to change XML parser from Microstar's AElfred parser to the SAX parser included with the Sun JRE
- changed SessionManager class to use the View.updateTitle() method to update the title bar, rather than sending a message on the EditBus

VERSION 1.4.2 (Steve Jakob)
- incorporated code submitted by strank (patch #1697914) to fix bug where current file was not being saved on Windows

VERSION 1.4.1 (Davide Del Vento, Steve Jakob)
- fixed bug (#1724376) the code submitted by strank conflicted with the behaviour of save confirmation dialog
- minor improvements in the save confirmation dialog (ask only if there are changes and show two separate lists)
- removed calls to deprecated jEdit MiscUtilities classes/methods

VERSION 1.4.0 (Steve Jakob)
- show more sessions in the SessionManagerDialog (based on code submitted by SourceForge user strank)
- retain file character encoding when saving/retrieving sessions
- retain carat position in each file when saving/retrieving sessions

VERSION 1.3.0 (Steve Jakob)
- added the option to display a confirmation dialog prior to session autosave (based on code submitted by Davide Del Vento)

VERSION 1.2.3 (Steve Jakob)
- fixed bug (#806606) where "\u" in a Windows directory path would get replaced with "\\" each time the session was switched, causing the path to get increasingly long
- fixed bug (#1108472) where session name in title bar was not always being updated

VERSION 1.2.2 (Paul Russell)
- fixed bug where reloading the Sessions plugin causes the Sessions toolbar to be displayed even if it is disabled in the Sessions Plugin options.
- added session name to the jEdit toobar. Configurable via the Sessions Plugin Options screen.  

VERSION 1.2.0 (Steve Jakob)
- updated to use the new plugin loading API introduced in jEdit 4.2pre1
- updated jEdit dependancy to version 4.2pre2, since there were problems with the new OptionPane API in pre1

VERSION 1.1.0 (Steve Jakob)
- fixed bug (#738931): renaming a session does not change the name in the XML file (Steve Jakob)
- updated jEdit dependancy to version 4.2pre1, since Sessions requires a recompile due to changes in jEdit's EBMessage class
- fixed bug (#536400): Selecting "Cancel" when asked to save unsaved files during session switch causes session name on toolbar to change, although the session does not actually change

VERSION 1.0.2 (Steve Jakob)
- fixed bug (#665623) where changing session would cause jEdit to hang. The SessionManager was using a separate thread to open the new session, which resulted in the Buffer being accessed in a non-thread-safe manner.

VERSION 1.0.1

- new option to add the session toolbar at the top of the BufferList plugin
  (needs BufferList 0.8 or higher)
- fixed toolbar icons
- fixed #461523: Session files occasionally get corrupted
- requires jEdit 4.0 or higher


VERSION 1.0.0 (unreleased)

- introduced session local properties (experimental!)
- new "Edit Session Properties" dialog (experimental!)
- allow third parties to add custom session property option panes,
  and to listen for property changes
- every session has two default properties: "basedir" and "mode"
- session files are now in XML format (old session files are
  automatically converted to the new format on the next run)
- faster session switching
- some refactorings (now has a real "Session" class)
- Ant instead of JMK makefile
- requires jEdit 3.2.1


VERSION 0.7.3
- SVU: Fix the bug introduced in 0.7.2


VERSION 0.7.2
- SVU: Two messages are fired: before changing the session and after the
  sesion is changed


VERSION 0.7.1

- the sessions toolbar can now be added to jEdit's main toolbar; saves screenspace
- requires jEdit 3.2.1


VERSION 0.7

- initial release, spun off from the BufferList Plugin 0.6.3
- as a result of the spin off, the Session Switcher toolbar can no longer be
  docked into BufferList. I'm searching for a remedy, but in the meantime
  your only choice is to dock it into the view at top.
- bugfix: switching sessions could cause the line numbers in the gutter
  to vanish (SessionsPlugin no longer sends out PropertiesChanged messages
  on session change)
- requires jEdit 3.2pre2 or higher
