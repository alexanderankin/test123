         This plugin provides some tools for working with JSON files: 
         <ul>
            <li>
               A SideKick for browsing JSON files.
            </li>
            <li>
               A beautifier to make JSON files human-readable.
            </li>
            <li>
               A minifier to make JSON files machine-readable.
            </li>
         </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
         Many JSON files are machine generated in a single line, the beautifier arranges the file in a more human-readable tree-like format, and the SideKick will make browsing that tree easier.
      </p>
      <p>
         In addition to beautifying a JSON file, this plugin has an action to "minify" a JSON file, that is, convert the JSON text into a single line minus whitespace, similar to many JSON files that are machine generated.  Note that the JSON specification does NOT allow JS style comments (// and /* ... */), the minifier will strip any such comments. Further, the beautifier will fail if such comments are in a given JSON file.
      </p>

            September 2023: 
            <br/>
            <ul>
               <li>
                  Moved the json beautifier from the Beauty plugin to this plugin since the parser code is identical.
               </li>
               <li>
                  Added minifier.
               </li>
            </ul>
         </li>
         <li>
            August 2023: Moved from XML plugin to be a separate plugin to be easier to maintain. The last version in the XML plugin would not work with the latest Antrl plugin.
         </li>
      </ul>
