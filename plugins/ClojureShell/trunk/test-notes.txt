There are four environments to check:

 1. Running without ProjectViewer installed.
    The rest of the environments assume that it is installed.
 2. Running without a project selected.
 3. Running with a non-Leiningen project selected (e.g. Java).
    Or any project without a project.clj present in the project root path.
 4. Running with a Leiningen project selected.
    Project root path must be set and a project.clj file present therein.

It seems impossible to create a ProjectViewer project without setting a
root path. There is code to handle this case but it has not been tested.

For each environment there are three settings to check:

 1. Use the clojure.jar.
 2. Use the Leiningen REPL where appropriate (context 4 above).
 3. Use the Leiningen REPL regardless.

Leiningen should only be used for setting #3 or a combination of setting #2
and environment #4. All other environment/setting combination should use the
installed Clojure.jar.

All testing was done against Clojure plugin version 2. No consideration was
given to supporting previous versions of the Clojure plugin.
