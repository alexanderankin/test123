		<b>ClojureShell</b> maintains a running Clojure environment and
		Read-Eval-Print-Loop in the Console.
	</p>
	<p>
		Actions are provided to quickly evaluate selected text, an open buffer,
		or a chosen external file in the shell,
		making it easy to run quick tests before committing code to your project.
	</p>
	<p>
		The Read-Eval-Print-Loop (REPL) is hosted by default by the
		<code>clojure.jar</code> installed using the <b>Clojure</b> plugin.
		<b>ClojureShell</b> can instead be configured to use the Leiningen tool.
		In this scenario, if the <b>ProjectViewer</b> plugin is also installed,
		the Leiningen REPL will be invoked in the project root directory,
		using the project's <code>project.clj</code> file.
