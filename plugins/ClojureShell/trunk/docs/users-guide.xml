		<para>
			The Clojure Shell plugin maintains an interactive Clojure environment within jEdit.
			This can be useful for running quick tests, or simply to play around with the language
			to get a better feel for its syntax.
		</para>
		<para>
			To use the plugin, open up the Console dockable and select the Clojure shell.
			Once selected, it will attempt to start up the Read-Eval-Print-Loop, and if successful,
			the Clojure prompt will be displayed. If not successful, the Clojure provider plugin
			may need to be configured. Refer to that plugin's documentation for information
			on how to configure it.

	<chapter id="actions"><title>Evaluating Code</title>
		<para>
			The easiest way to evaluate code in the shell is to simply type it in and hit enter.
			But there are several actions available that make it easier to test a portion of your
			code without having to manually copy and paste it.
		</para>
		<para>
			These actions can be found in Plugins -> Clojure Shell. Using these actions, you can
			use the shell to evaluate the active buffer, any selected text within that buffer, 
			or an external Clojure script.
		</para>
		<para>
			Any variables or functions defined in the shell will persist until the loop is
			manually stopped and restarted.
		</para>
	</chapter>
	<chapter id="stop-restart"><title>Stopping and Restarting</title>
		<para>
			To stop the loop, click on the Stop button in the Console dockable. After it's stopped,
			hit Enter to start it back up again. Restarting can be used to reset the environment,
			or you can simply stop the loop to conserve system resources.
