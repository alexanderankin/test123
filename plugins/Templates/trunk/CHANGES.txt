- Fix bug where the 'Edit Template' doesn't open to the template directory (Calvin Yu).

- overhauled accelerator expansion function to fix bug where expansion of template accelerator at the start of a buffer would cause a BeanShell error (array index out of bounds (-1)) (Steve Jakob)

CHANGES:
- updated Templates to be compliant with jEdit 4.0 actions API
ENHANCEMENTS:
- all template menu items are now created using BeanShellAction objects, 
which allows menu selections to be used in recorded macros 

Version 1.1.0 (16-JULY-2001)
=============================
BUG FIX:
- updated TemplatesPlugin to use createMenuItems(Vector menuItems), rather 
than the deprecated createMenuItems(View view, Vector menus, Vector menuItems).

Version 1.0.2 (04-DEC-2000)
=============================
BUG FIX:
- the signature of org.gjt.sp.jedit.EditAction (2.7pre2) was changed such that 
it no longer implements ActionListener. TemplatesAction was modified to 
implement ActionListener directly, instead of relying on the EditAction 
superclass. Tested against jEdit 2.7pre2, as well as 2.6final.

Version 1.0.1 (20-APR-2000)
=============================
CHANGES:
- updated TemplatesOptionPane for compliance with new OptionPane interface 
in jEdit 2.4pre6. The class remains compatible with earlier releases, though.

Version 1.0.0 (08-MAR-2000)
=============================
BUG FIXES:
- fixed problem with Templates menu, whereby the menu was present only 
in the most current view (as reported by Slava Pestov)
ENHANCEMENTS:
- added support for #ctpragma directives; as of this version only 
the "#ctpragma LABEL" (aka "#ctpragma NAME") has been implemented. 
This directive allows the user to specify within the template file 
a label to denote that template in the Templates menu.
- updated online documentation
CHANGES:
- log error messages with org.gjt.sp.util.Log class rather than 
System.out.println. Therefore, the plugin now requires jEdit 2.2Final 
or better.
- use properties for error messages, rather than hard-coded strings

reported by Juha Lindfors)

properties file format (M. Dillon)

subdirectory becomes a submenu on the "Templates" menu
