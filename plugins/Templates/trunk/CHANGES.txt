Version 3.0.0 (???)
=============================
ENHANCEMENTS:
Added support for template labeling via "#template=" statement.
Added Calvin's dockable window for template selection.

Version 2.9.9 (30-APR-2002)
=============================
Pre-release for testing integration of Calvin Yu's Velocity classes.
Directory hierarchy changed to separate Velocity classes from Templates plugin classes.
Changed to ant for build management.

Version 2.0.2 (08-MAR-2002)
=============================
BUG FIX:
- fixed problem with file paths on Windows, where BeanShell threw an exception on encountering a backslash when processing a TemplateAction object (as reported by Arno Verhoeven) 

Version 2.0.1 (25-FEB-2002)
=============================
BUG FIX:
- fixed problem with templates directory not being created (as reported by Will Sargent) 

Version 2.0.0 (21-FEB-2002)
=============================
CHANGES:
- updated Templates to be compliant with jEdit 4.0 actions API
ENHANCEMENTS:
- all template menu items are now created using BeanShellAction objects, 
which allows menu selections to be used in recorded macros 

Version 1.1.0 (16-JULY-2001)
=============================
BUG FIX:
- updated TemplatesPlugin to use createMenuItems(Vector menuItems), rather 
than the deprecated createMenuItems(View view, Vector menus, Vector menuItems).
ENHANCEMENTS:
- added "Edit Template" function to Templates menu
- added "Save Template" function to Templates menu

Version 1.0.2 (04-DEC-2000)
=============================
BUG FIX:
- the signature of org.gjt.sp.jedit.EditAction (2.7pre2) was changed such that 
it no longer implements ActionListener. TemplatesAction was modified to 
implement ActionListener directly, instead of relying on the EditAction 
superclass. Tested against jEdit 2.7pre2, as well as 2.6final.

Version 1.0.1 (20-APR-2000)
=============================
CHANGES:
- updated TemplatesOptionPane for compliance with new OptionPane interface 
in jEdit 2.4pre6. The class remains compatible with earlier releases, though.

Version 1.0.0 (08-MAR-2000)
=============================
BUG FIXES:
- fixed problem with Templates menu, whereby the menu was present only 
in the most current view (as reported by Slava Pestov)
ENHANCEMENTS:
- added support for #ctpragma directives; as of this version only 
the "#ctpragma LABEL" (aka "#ctpragma NAME") has been implemented. 
This directive allows the user to specify within the template file 
a label to denote that template in the Templates menu.
- updated online documentation
CHANGES:
- log error messages with org.gjt.sp.util.Log class rather than 
System.out.println. Therefore, the plugin now requires jEdit 2.2Final 
or better.
- use properties for error messages, rather than hard-coded strings

reported by Juha Lindfors)

properties file format (M. Dillon)
