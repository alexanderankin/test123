CHANGES file for Templates plugin.

Version 1.0.2 (04-DEC-2000)
=============================
BUG FIX:
- the signature of org.gjt.sp.jedit.EditAction (2.7pre2) was changed such that 
it no longer implements ActionListener. TemplatesAction was modified to 
implement ActionListener directly, instead of relying on the EditAction 
superclass. Tested against jEdit 2.7pre2, as well as 2.6final.

Version 1.0.1 (20-APR-2000)
=============================
CHANGES:
- updated TemplatesOptionPane for compliance with new OptionPane interface 
in jEdit 2.4pre6. The class remains compatible with earlier releases, though.

Version 1.0.0 (08-MAR-2000)
=============================
BUG FIXES:
- fixed problem with Templates menu, whereby the menu was present only 
in the most current view (as reported by Slava Pestov)
ENHANCEMENTS:
- added support for #ctpragma directives; as of this version only 
the "#ctpragma LABEL" (aka "#ctpragma NAME") has been implemented. 
This directive allows the user to specify within the template file 
a label to denote that template in the Templates menu.
- updated online documentation
CHANGES:
- log error messages with org.gjt.sp.util.Log class rather than 
System.out.println. Therefore, the plugin now requires jEdit 2.2Final 
or better.
- use properties for error messages, rather than hard-coded strings

Version 0.3.2 (15-JAN-2000)
=============================
BUG FIXES:
- fixed problem with end-of-line markers being handled incorrectly (as
reported by Juha Lindfors)

Version 0.3.1 (10-JAN-2000)
=============================
CHANGES:
- in TemplatesPlugin.createMenuItems(), Templates submenu now added to 
menus vector, not menuItems (M. Dillon)
- changed comments style in Templates.props to conform to standard Java 
properties file format (M. Dillon)
- added missing Templates.html help file back into distribution

Version 0.3.0 (20-DEC-1999)
=============================
ENHANCEMENTS:
- user-configurable templates directory via "Plugin Options"
- recursive scanning of template directory and its subdirectories; each
subdirectory becomes a submenu on the "Templates" menu

Version 0.2.1 (11-DEC-1999)
=============================
BUG FIXES:
- fixed strange ClassCastException which showed up on Windows, but not Linux

Version 0.2.0 (10-DEC-1999)
=============================
- Initial public alpha release
