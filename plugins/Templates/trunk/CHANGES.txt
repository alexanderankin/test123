CHANGES file for Templates plugin.

Version 3.2.0 (25-MAY-2003)
=============================
CHANGES:
- removed dependancy on commons-collections.jar
- added dependancy on JakartaCommons plugin
- changed jEdit dependancy from version 4.0pre4 to version 4.2pre1
- updated Templates to be compliant with jEdit 4.2 API changes

Version 3.1.0 (03-FEB-2003)
=============================
BUG FIX:
- fixed error in #beanshell directive example code in help documentation
- fixed problem where, if #caret() directive was the first thing in a template, the caret would end up at the end of the file, rather than the beginning (reported by Hajo Wuellner)
- Fix bug where the 'Edit Template' doesn't open to the template directory (Calvin Yu).
- Applied same fix to 'Save Template' option (Steve Jakob)
- overhauled accelerator expansion function to fix bug where expansion of template accelerator at the start of a buffer would cause a BeanShell error (array index out of bounds (-1)) (Steve Jakob)
- fixed problem in velocity.properties where backslash was not recognized as a line continuation indicator in Windows. The "userdirective" entry is now all on one line (reported by Lee Turner/Rob Fletcher)
- fixed properties loading problem where use of a custom velocity.properties file would result in the normal properties not getting loaded. Now custom properties will override normal properties. (Steve Jakob)
- fixed macro reloading problem, where changes to a Velocimacro were not reflected until jEdit was restarted (Calvin Yu)
ENHANCEMENTS:
- Added $_jeditSelection which represents the current buffer selection (Calvin Yu).
- added ability to "pass through" an abbreviation from the "Expand Accelerator" action to jEdit's abbreviation expansion function, if no matching template accelerator is found (Steve Jakob)
- added option to Templates General option pane to configure "pass through" to abbreviation expansion (Steve Jakob)
- added an optional boolean parameter to the #beanshell() directive to allow suppression of output of the last result in the script; documentation updated accordingly (Calvin Yu)
- Velocity engine updated from version 1.3-rc1 to 1.3.1-rc2

Version 3.0.1 (16-AUG-2002)
=============================
BUG FIX:
- fixed problem with regular expression for filtering backup files, where it would filter all files if backup filename prefix and suffix both blank (fix submitted by John Murga) 
- fixed problem with dockable tree view not updating in response to "Refresh templates" request
ENHANCEMENTS:
- updated help documentation with regards to plugin configuration and template creation procedures

Version 3.0.0 (29-JUL-2002)

CHANGES:
Templates plugin now uses Apache Velocity as its templating engine (Calvin Yu).
ENHANCEMENTS:
Added support for template labeling via "## template=" statement.
Added Calvin's dockable window for template selection.
Switched to Docbook for help documentation.
Modified Calvin's AcceleratorManager to use a more readable storage format, very similar to property files.
Added a dirty flag to AcceleratorManager so that accelerators are saved only if there are changes.
Added a field to the options pane to allow selection of the directory containing Velocity configuration files.

Version 2.9.9 (30-APR-2002)
=============================
Pre-release for testing integration of Calvin Yu's Velocity classes.
Directory hierarchy changed to separate Velocity classes from Templates plugin classes.
Changed to ant for build management.

Version 2.0.2 (08-MAR-2002)
=============================
BUG FIX:
- fixed problem with file paths on Windows, where BeanShell threw an exception on encountering a backslash when processing a TemplateAction object (as reported by Arno Verhoeven) 

Version 2.0.1 (25-FEB-2002)
=============================
BUG FIX:
- fixed problem with templates directory not being created (as reported by Will Sargent) 

Version 2.0.0 (21-FEB-2002)
=============================
CHANGES:
- updated Templates to be compliant with jEdit 4.0 actions API
ENHANCEMENTS:
- all template menu items are now created using BeanShellAction objects, 
which allows menu selections to be used in recorded macros 

Version 1.1.0 (16-JULY-2001)
=============================
BUG FIX:
- updated TemplatesPlugin to use createMenuItems(Vector menuItems), rather 
than the deprecated createMenuItems(View view, Vector menus, Vector menuItems).
ENHANCEMENTS:
- added "Edit Template" function to Templates menu
- added "Save Template" function to Templates menu

Version 1.0.2 (04-DEC-2000)
=============================
BUG FIX:
- the signature of org.gjt.sp.jedit.EditAction (2.7pre2) was changed such that 
it no longer implements ActionListener. TemplatesAction was modified to 
implement ActionListener directly, instead of relying on the EditAction 
superclass. Tested against jEdit 2.7pre2, as well as 2.6final.

Version 1.0.1 (20-APR-2000)
=============================
CHANGES:
- updated TemplatesOptionPane for compliance with new OptionPane interface 
in jEdit 2.4pre6. The class remains compatible with earlier releases, though.

Version 1.0.0 (08-MAR-2000)
=============================
BUG FIXES:
- fixed problem with Templates menu, whereby the menu was present only 
in the most current view (as reported by Slava Pestov)
ENHANCEMENTS:
- added support for #ctpragma directives; as of this version only 
the "#ctpragma LABEL" (aka "#ctpragma NAME") has been implemented. 
This directive allows the user to specify within the template file 
a label to denote that template in the Templates menu.
- updated online documentation
CHANGES:
- log error messages with org.gjt.sp.util.Log class rather than 
System.out.println. Therefore, the plugin now requires jEdit 2.2Final 
or better.
- use properties for error messages, rather than hard-coded strings

BUG FIXES:

reported by Juha Lindfors)

properties file format (M. Dillon)
- added missing Templates.html help file back into distribution

Version 0.3.0 (20-DEC-1999)

ENHANCEMENTS:
- user-configurable templates directory via "Plugin Options"
- recursive scanning of template directory and its subdirectories; each
subdirectory becomes a submenu on the "Templates" menu
