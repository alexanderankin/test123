		The Templates plugin allows dynamic generation of source code and other 
		files based on template files. The incorporation of the Apache Velocity 
		templating engine as of version 3.0.0 allows for a great deal of 
		flexibility and interactivity. Templates may be accessed through the 
		Plugins menu or a dockable tree view.
