	 * Change Log:

	 * Revision 1.1  2001/07/16 19:10:13  sjakob
	 * BUG FIX: updated TemplatesPlugin to use createMenuItems(Vector menuItems),
	 * rather than the deprecated createMenuItems(View view, Vector menus,
	 * Vector menuItems), which caused startup errors.
	 * Added Mike Dillon's makefile.jmk.
