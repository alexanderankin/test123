CtagsSideKick provides a structure browser service for SideKick using exuberant ctags. Support exists for these languages: C, C++, Perl, Python, Bash, Java, JavaScript, Lisp, Make, PHP, Ruby, Scheme, SQL, YACC, XML, Ant, Cobol, Eiffel, AWK, Fortran, and Pascal.
</p>
<p> CtagsSideKick is based on the CodeBrowser plugin, but it can  group tags by namespace (e.g. grouping class members under their class), and provides icons representing the tag type (function/variable/...). These are especially useful when there are several tags of the same name in the buffer, which is common in object-oriented languages such as C++ and Java.
