CtagsSideKick is a SideKick service that provides a tag tree for the current
buffer based on the output of the "Exuberant ctags" tool, to simplify
navigation in the current buffer. CtagsSideKick is an enhanced version of the
CodeBrowser plugin, that can group tags by namespace (e.g. grouping class
members under their class), and provides icons representing the tag type
(function/variable/...). These are especially useful when there are several
tags of the same name in the buffer, which is common in object-oriented
languages such as C++ and Java.
Unlike CodeBrowser, CtagsSideKick does not contain a buffer switcher.
