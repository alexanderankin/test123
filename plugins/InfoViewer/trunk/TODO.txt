TODO for InfoViewer
-------------------

If tree is focused, and we press tab, where does the focus go? It seems to be nowhere. Keys don't respond at all.

Bug# 2927178:
For tree nodes that point to a part of the document i.e. end with something like #d0e310:
    Why when clicking on tree nodes, does it always first open at the top of the html file and require you to click a second time on the tree node before it scrolls to the correct location in the page?

Add a "auto-reload" toggle button, which will toggle reload on buffer-save.

Under Edit, add a "preferences" menu. show the "internal infoviewer" options from there?

F6 should focus on textarea and select text from all other widgets.

We need visual feedback when the editor pane has focus. like a border around the thing.

When the editor pane has focus, and we are not selecting anything, the arrow keys should be handled by the scrollpane that is wrapped around it, not by the editorpane itself. At the moment, arrow keys move around an invisible cursor, which is confusing - you can press downarrow for a while, nothing happens, and then suddenly your down arrow works but your up arrow doesn't. Annoying. Maybe we need a togglebutton that lets you switch between a visible cursor (and text select mode), and scroll mode (like the hand tool in acrobat).

After mouse click on the tree view, it should change keyboard focus to the editor pane.


* Redesign search/index (actually from core) to use lucene
* Find - firefox-like with the "/" key, popup an incremental search for the window.

* Add another tab to the sidebar for bookmarks
   Permit direct manipulation of bookmarks via this sidebar.
* Allow users to add JAR files and directory trees that also get indexed in the help search facility.
* Allow multiple instances of InfoViewer windows:
  - menu "File": New window, Clone window
  - right-click popup: Open link in a new window
  - new "Windows" menu: quick jump to other InfoViewer windows
  - We need an action suitable for adding to projectviewer's context menu "open in infoviewer".

* stop button
* progress bar (use EditorPane.getStream())
* Option "InternalBrowser/Appeareance/Join Tool and Addressbar" ?
