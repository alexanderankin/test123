TODO for InfoViewer
-------------------

* Fix the shortcuts so that they actually work.
* Rewrite InfoViewerAction to be an EditAction - translate the action code
   into beanshell - add the actions to actions.xml
* Allow multiple instances of InfoViewer windows:
  - menu "File": New window, Clone window
  - right-click popup: Open link in a new window
  - new "Windows" menu: quick jump to other InfoViewer windows
* stop button
* progress bar (use EditorPane.getStream())
* Option "InternalBrowser/Appeareance/Join Tool and Addressbar" ?
