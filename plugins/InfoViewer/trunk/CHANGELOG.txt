  bring the netscape window to front.

Version 0.4.0
-------------
* Bookmarks
* New option in Plugin Options: "Select browser: Class in classpath"
  You may enter any class name and a method name.
  The method must be static and accept either a String or an URL or null
  parameters (in that order). You may omit the method, meaning that the 
  constructor of the class is invoked, with either a String, an URL or null
  parameters (in that order).
  So now you can invoke Java browsers in the same virtual machine, like 
  ICEBrowser or Jazilla.
* New option in Plugin Options: "Select browser: Netscape (with reuse, Unix only)"
  Uses Netscape with the raiseURL() option, and starts a new process, if
  Netscape is not running.
* New "Open File..." command
* New "Edit URL" command
* New "Select All" command
* New "Copy" command
* New homepage property
* New Help menu displaying plugin documentations.
* Window title is set according to <TITLE>
* BugFix: the "Open..." command was broken in jEdit 2.3pre2 and higher.
* Requires jEdit 2.3pre6 or higher and EditBus 0.9.1 or higher


Version 0.3
-----------
* Has two new commands: "View current buffer in InfoViewer" and
  "View selected URL in InfoViewer" (Copied from the HTML Plugin). 
  Thus, InfoViewer has now a submenu on the plugins menu.
* The Go to: field is now a history field.
* Now listens to ViewURL messages (from the EditBus plugin) instead of 
  ViewInfo messages. This means, that InfoViewer is dependant on the
  EditBus plugin, but other plugins can utilize the InfoViewer without
  knowing it at compile time. The ViewInfo message from version 0.2 is no
  longer.
* BugFix: no longer adds itself to EditBus (jEdit does this).
* Requires jEdit 2.2pre9 or higher and EditBus 0.8 or higher.


Version 0.2
-----------

* may now invoke an external browser like Netscape etc.
* changed EditBus message name from "infoviewer.msg.Help" to 
  "org.gjt.sp.jedit.msg.ViewInfo" to prepare EditBus integration.


Version 0.1
-----------
* initial release
* requires jEdit 2.2pre6 or higher, JDK 1.1 or higher
