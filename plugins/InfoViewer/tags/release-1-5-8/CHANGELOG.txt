ChangeLog for InfoViewer plugin
===========================================================================

Version 1.5.8  Depends on jedit 4.3pre5, Java 1.4
    * Listens to arrow keys in the viewer
    * Fixed action infoviewer.open that was calling
      infoviewer.InfoViewerPlugin.openURL(view, null, -1)
      that doesn't exist anymore (Matthieu Casanova)
    * Now remembers vertical scrollbar positions at
      hyperlink click locations, so when you go "back", you
      will actually go where you were when you clicked on the link. 
      (Alan Ezust) 

Version 1.5.6 Depends: jEdit 4.3pre3, Java 1.4 
    * History, Back and Forward actions rewritten - now the current position
      gets pushed onto the forward stack when back is pressed, and vice-versa.
      (Alan Ezust)  

Version 1.5.5 Depends: jEdit 4.3pre3, Java 1.4
      HelpViewer shows the help sidebar, InfoViewer hides the help sidebar 
      The same class is used for both dockables, so you can show/hide it
      from the "View" menu. (Alan Ezust)

Version 1.5 - requires jedit 4.3pre3, Java 1.4 
    * Added option to use InfoViewer instead of HelpViewer
    * Added HelpInfoViewer - an InfoViewer with the Help table of contents
        as an optional sidebar. (Alan Ezust)

    * the internal (Java/Swing driven) browser is now dockable into jEdit's view.
      Use this to create a HTML preview pane, when editing HTML files.

VERSION 0.4.0

    * bookmarks
    * new option in Plugin Options: "Select browser: Class in classpath"
      You may enter any class name and a method name.
      The method must be static and accept either a String or an URL or null
      parameters (in that order). You may omit the method, meaning that the
      constructor of the class is invoked, with either a String, an URL or null
      parameters (in that order).
      So now you can invoke Java browsers in the same virtual machine, like
      ICEBrowser or Jazilla.

      Uses Netscape with the raiseURL() option, and starts a new process, if
      Netscape is not running.

VERSION 0.3

    * has two new commands: "View current buffer in InfoViewer" and
      "View selected URL in InfoViewer" (Copied from the HTML Plugin).
      Thus, InfoViewer has now a submenu on the plugins menu.
    * the Go to: field is now a history field.
    * now listens to ViewURL messages (from the EditBus plugin) instead of
      ViewInfo messages. This means, that InfoViewer is dependant on the
      EditBus plugin, but other plugins can utilize the InfoViewer without
      knowing it at compile time. The ViewInfo message from version 0.2 is no
      longer.
    * bugfix: no longer adds itself to EditBus (jEdit does this).
    * requires jEdit 2.2pre9 or higher and EditBus 0.8 or higher.


VERSION 0.2

    * may now invoke an external browser like Netscape etc.
    * changed EditBus message name from "infoviewer.msg.Help" to
      "org.gjt.sp.jedit.msg.ViewInfo" to prepare EditBus integration.
