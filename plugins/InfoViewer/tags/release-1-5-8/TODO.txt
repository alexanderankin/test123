TODO for InfoViewer
-------------------
* Redesign search/index (actually from core) to use lucene
* Find - firefox-like with the "/" key, popup an incremental search for the window.
* Get up and down arrow keys working 
* Add another tab to the sidebar for bookmarks
   Permit direct manipulation of bookmarks via this sidebar.
* Allow users to add JAR files and directory trees that also get indexed in the help
   search facility? Or is that for JIndex to do?
* Allow multiple instances of InfoViewer windows:
  - menu "File": New window, Clone window
  - right-click popup: Open link in a new window
  - new "Windows" menu: quick jump to other InfoViewer windows
  - We need an action suitable for adding to projectviewer's context menu "open in infoviewer". 
  
* stop button
* progress bar (use EditorPane.getStream())
* Option "InternalBrowser/Appeareance/Join Tool and Addressbar" ?
