		<p>
			<b>Summary</b>
		</p>
		<p> ClangCompletion provides jEdit with code completion and syntax checking for c, c++ and objective-c using the clang and llvm.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Usage</b>
		</p>
		<p>	ClangCompletion needs <tt>clang</tt> inside the system path,
		or you can set the absolute path from <b>Plugin Options - ClangCompletion</b>. </p>
		<p>
		    You can download and install clang and llvm from
			<a href="http://llvm.org/">http://llvm.org</a>, but
			try to use your package manager to install it first,
			if you are on an operating system that has one. </p>
		<p>
			ClangCompletion will check the syntax every time you
			save your c, c++ or objc buffer.
			You can disable this from <b>Plugin Options - ClangCompletion</b>.
			It will show errors in the <a href="/ErrorList.jar!/index.html">ErrorList</a>.
        </p>
        <p> This plugin provides a completion service via the
			<a href="/Completion.jar!/index.html">Completion Plugin</a>.
			The completion will automatically show or need a key to
			popup depending on the Completion Plugin options.
		</p>
        <p> ClangCompletion plugin provides a
            <a href="/ProjectViewer.jar!/index.html">Project Viewer</a>
            option pane to configure include paths and precompiled definitions
            for a given project.
			Right-click the project root node from the ProjectViewer tree
			and select <b>Properties</b> to see the <b>ClangCompletion</b> option pane.
			You need to fill in the same options there as you would for a Makefile or an IDE.
		</p>

		<p> If the expansion is a something with parameters, such as a function, then
		    <a href="/SuperAbbrevs.jar!/index.html">SuperAbbrevs</a> is used
		    to display and expand the completion, and permit you to use
		    the tab key to navigate the parameters. </p>
