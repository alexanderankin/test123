<h1>CharacterMap Plugin V1.3</h1>

by Slava Pestov<BR>and Mark Wickens<br>and Max Funk

<h2> Introduction </h2>

The character map plugin displays a window showing all ASCII and extended 
characters. Clicking one will insert it in the buffer.

<h2> Description </h2>

The CharacterMap plugin displays a dockable window listing all characters in
a specified encoding, which can be selected using the combo box at the top of
the window. For non-unicode encodings the table contains 256 characters that
represent the entire character set. 
<P>
For Unicode, (UTF8, UTF16, UTF32) the table displays the selected unicode block.
Currently only the &quot;basic multilingual plane&quot; is supported, i.e. 
the first 65536 unicode characters.
<P>
To specify a custom encoding, type the name directly into the encoding combo
box text field. Any custom encodings entered are stored in the combo box list
to ease later selection.
<P>
Moving the cursor over the characters in the table updates the status line at 
the bottom of the window and (if enabled) displays the character under the 
mouse pointer at the top-right of the window.
<P>
Clicking on a character with Button 1 on the mouse (typically the left button)
will cause the character to be inserted at the cursor position in the current
buffer.
<P>
Pressing and holding button 3 on the mouse (typically the right button)
will display an enlarged (depending on the size specified) version of the 
character overlayed at the current pointer position.
<P>
The characters in the table are rendered in the font style and size selected 
for the text area. The anti-alias and fractional font metrics options are 
also honoured.
<P>
The following options can be specified:
<ul>
    <li><p>Show large character: displays a large representation of 
	the character under the cursor in the top-right hand corner of the
	window.</p></li>
    <li><p>Large character size: controls the size (in points) of the 
	large character.</p></li>
    <li><p>Show right-click character: displays a representation of the
	character under the cursor when the right-mouse button is pressed 
	overlayed at the current cursor position.</p></li>
	<li><p>Right-click character size: controls the size (in points) of the 
	right-click character.</p></li>
	<li><p>Offset right-click character: offsets the position at which the
	right-click character is displayed so that it is easier to see other
	characters in the current characters rank and file.</p></li>
	<li><p>Table columns: specify the number of columns to be displayed...</p> 
    <ol><li><p>floating: if the table is floating (un-docked).</p></li>
    <li><p>docked l/r: if the table is docked left or right.</p></li>
	<li><p>docked t/b: if the table is docked at top or bottom.</p></ol></li>
	<li><p>Show status line: controls whether the status line at the bottom
	of the window is displayed. The status line contains</p>
    <ol><li><p>the	character code point in decimal and hexadecimal form,</p></li> 
	<li><p> the bytes forming the character in hexadecimal form (for UTF-encoded
    unicode,</p></li>
    <li><p>the name of the character (for unicode).</p></li></ol></li>
	<li><p>Show encoding combo box: Controls whether the encoding combo box
	is displayed. By default the encoding is selected from the encoding specified
	for the currently selected buffer.</p></li>
	<li><p>Show unicode blocks combo box: Controls whether the unicode blocks 
	combo box is displayed. The blocks combo box is only enabled when editing 
	a unicode buffer or when unicode encoding
	has been specified in the encoding combo box.</p></li>
	<li><p>Always use anti-aliasing: If set, the character glyphs are always
	rendered anti-aliased (smoothed). If not set the anti-aliasing options 
	are taken from the Global Options -> Text Area settings.</p></li>
</ul>
