<h1>CharacterMap Plugin V1.3</h1>

by Slava Pestov<BR>and Mark Wickens<br>and Max Funk

<h2> Introduction </h2>

<p>The character map plugin displays a window showing all ASCII and extended
characters, depending on the selected encoding.</p>
<p>Clicking one will insert it into the buffer.</p>


<h2> Description </h2>

<p>In a dockable window a character table is shown. Clicking on a character with
Button 1 on the mouse (typically the left button) will cause the character to be
inserted at the cursor position in the current buffer.
Moving the cursor over the characters in the table updates the status line at
the bottom of the window and (if enabled) displays the character at the top-right
of the window. Pressing and holding button 3 on the mouse (typically the right button)
will display an enlarged version of the character overlayed at the current
pointer position.</p>
<p>For non-unicode encodings the table contains 256 characters, that
represent (mostly) the entire character set.
For Unicode (UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-32) the table displays the selected unicode block,
shown in the blocks combo box.
By default, only the &quot;basic multilingual plane&quot; is shown, i.e.
the first 65536 unicode characters. In the options (see below) you can activate
all Unicode planes.</p>
<p>The encoding of the table is shown in the encoding combo box (if enabled).
You can change it with the dropdown list or directly type it into the text field.
The encoding of the current buffer / file is shown in the jEdit status line.
Opening or changing a buffer resets the table to the encoding of the buffer.</p>
<p> Character Map will refuse to insert characters from different encodings into
a non-unicode buffer. If you still want to insert the character, you must change
the encoding in the buffer options.
Be careful: Some applications may require a specific encoding. Also, if you
change to another non-Unicode encoding, some other characters of the buffer may
not be present in the new encoding.</p>
<p>The characters in the table are rendered in the font style and size selected
for the text area. The anti-alias and fractional font metrics options are
honoured. If automatic font substitution is enabled, preferred fonts are also
honoured. You can e.g. try the fonts Code2000-2002 (currently available at
code2000.sourceforge.net). Install and activate them in &quot;jEdit - Global
Options - Text Area - Automatic Font Substitution&quot;. </p>


<h2> Options </h2>

The following options can be specified in the option pane.
<ul>
	<li>Show encoding combo box: Controls whether the encoding combo box
	is displayed. By default the encoding is selected from the encoding specified
	for the currently selected buffer.</li>
	<li>Show unicode blocks combo box: Controls whether the unicode blocks
	combo box is displayed. The blocks combo box is only enabled when editing
	a unicode buffer or when unicode encoding has been specified in the
	encoding combo box.</li>
	<li>Include higher Unicode planes: Not only the blocks from Plane 1
	(Basic Multilingual Plane), but also from higher Planes are shown.
	This enables Unicode Characters with Codepoints > 65536 or 0xFFFF.
	Be aware: This is a Beta Feature, since Java encodes these Characters with
	two elementary chars instead of one, and you may experience compatibility
	issues in jEdit.</li>
	<li>Always use anti-aliasing: If set, the character glyphs are always
	rendered anti-aliased (smoothed). If not set the anti-aliasing options
	are taken from the Global Options -> Text Area settings.</li>
	<li>Table columns: specify the number of columns to be displayed...</li>
	<ol>
		<li>floating: if the table is floating (un-docked).</li>
		<li>docked l/r: if the table is docked left or right.</li>
		<li>docked t/b: if the table is docked at top or bottom.</li>
	</ol>
	<li>Show status line: controls whether the status line at the bottom
	of the window is displayed. The status line contains</li>
	<ol>
		<li>the character code point in decimal and hexadecimal form,</li>
		<li> the bytes forming the character in hexadecimal form
		(for UTF-encoded unicode,</li>
		<li>the name of the character (for unicode).</li>
	</ol>
	<li>Large character: displays a large representation of
	the character under the cursor in the top-right hand corner of the
	window.</li>
	<ol>
		<li>Show large character: display the character.</li>
		<li>Large character size: controls the size (in points) of the
		large character.</li>
	</ol>
	<li>Show right-click character: displays a representation of the
	character under the cursor when the right-mouse button is pressed
	overlayed at the current cursor position.</li>
	<ol>
		<li>Show right-click character: display the character.</li>
		<li>Offset right-click character: offsets the position at which the
		right-click character is displayed so that it is easier to see other
		characters in the current characters rank and file.</li>
		<li>Right-click character size: controls the size (in points) of the
		right-click character.</li>
	</ol>
</ul>
