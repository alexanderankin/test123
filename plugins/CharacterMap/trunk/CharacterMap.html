<h1>CharacterMap Plugin V1.3</h1>

by Slava Pestov<BR>and Mark Wickens<br>and Max Funk

<h2> Introduction </h2>

<p>The character map plugin displays a window showing all ASCII and extended
characters, depending on the selected encoding.</p>
<p>Clicking one will insert it into the buffer.</p>


<h2> Description </h2>

In a dockable window all characters in a specified encoding are shown, which
can be selected using the combo box at the top of the window.
<P>For non-unicode encodings the table contains 256 characters that
represent the entire character set.
For Unicode, (UTF8, UTF16, UTF32) the table displays the selected unicode block.
By default, only the &quot;basic multilingual plane&quot; is shown, i.e.
the first 65536 unicode characters.</P>
<P>By default, the current buffer encoding is used.
To specify a custom encoding, type the name directly into the encoding combo
box text field. Any custom encodings entered are stored in the combo box list
to ease later selection.</P>
<P>Moving the cursor over the characters in the table updates the status line at
the bottom of the window and (if enabled) displays the character at the top-right of the window.</P>
<P>Clicking on a character with Button 1 on the mouse (typically the left button)
will cause the character to be inserted at the cursor position in the current
buffer.</P>
<P>Pressing and holding button 3 on the mouse (typically the right button)
will display an enlarged version of the character overlayed at the current
pointer position.</P>
<P>The characters in the table are rendered in the font style and size selected
for the text area. The anti-alias and fractional font metrics options are
honoured.</P>
<P>If automatic font substitution is enabled, preferred fonts are also honoured.
You can e.g. try the fonts Code2000-2002 (currently available at
code2000.sourceforge.net). Activate them in &quot;jEdit - Global Options -
Text Area - Automatic Font Substitution&quot;.</P>


<h2> Options </h2>

The following options can be specified in the option pane.
<ul>
	<li>Show encoding combo box: Controls whether the encoding combo box
	is displayed. By default the encoding is selected from the encoding specified
	for the currently selected buffer.</li>
	<li>Show unicode blocks combo box: Controls whether the unicode blocks
	combo box is displayed. The blocks combo box is only enabled when editing
	a unicode buffer or when unicode encoding has been specified in the
	encoding combo box.</li>
	<li>Include higher Unicode planes: Not only the blocks from Plane 1
	(Basic Multilingual Plane), but also from higher Planes are shown.
	This enables Unicode Characters with Codepoints > 65536 or 0xFFFF.
	Be aware: This is a Beta Feature, since Java encodes these Characters with
	two elementary chars instead of one, and you may experience compatibility
	issues in jEdit.</li>
	<li>Always use anti-aliasing: If set, the character glyphs are always
	rendered anti-aliased (smoothed). If not set the anti-aliasing options
	are taken from the Global Options -> Text Area settings.</li>
	<li>Table columns: specify the number of columns to be displayed...</li>
	<ol>
		<li>floating: if the table is floating (un-docked).</li>
		<li>docked l/r: if the table is docked left or right.</li>
		<li>docked t/b: if the table is docked at top or bottom.</li>
	</ol>
	<li>Show status line: controls whether the status line at the bottom
	of the window is displayed. The status line contains</li>
	<ol>
		<li>the character code point in decimal and hexadecimal form,</li>
		<li> the bytes forming the character in hexadecimal form
		(for UTF-encoded unicode,</li>
		<li>the name of the character (for unicode).</li>
	</ol>
	<li>Large character: displays a large representation of
	the character under the cursor in the top-right hand corner of the
	window.</li>
	<ol>
		<li>Show large character: display the character.</li>
		<li>Large character size: controls the size (in points) of the
		large character.</li>
	</ol>
	<li>Show right-click character: displays a representation of the
	character under the cursor when the right-mouse button is pressed
	overlayed at the current cursor position.</li>
	<ol>
		<li>Show right-click character: display the character.</li>
		<li>Offset right-click character: offsets the position at which the
		right-click character is displayed so that it is easier to see other
		characters in the current characters rank and file.</li>
		<li>Right-click character size: controls the size (in points) of the
		right-click character.</li>
	</ol>
</ul>
