<h1>CharacterMap Plugin V1.2</h1>

<h3>by Slava Pestov<BR>and Mark Wickens</h3>

The CharacterMap plugin displays a dockable window listing all characters in
a specified encoding, which can be selected using the combo box at the top of
the window. For non-unicode encodings the table contains 256 characters that
represent the entire character set. If the encoding is Unicode or UTF8 the table
displays a 256-character page of the encoding. The page can be changed using the
unicode blocks control.
<P>
To specify a custom encoding, type the name directly into the encoding combo
box text field. Any custom encodings entered are stored in the combo box list
to ease later selection.
<P>
Moving the cursor over the characters in the table updates the status line at 
the bottom of the window and (if enabled) displays the character under the 
mouse pointer at the top-right of the window.
<P>
Clicking on a character with Button 1 on the mouse (typically the left button)
will cause the character to be inserted at the cursor position in the current
buffer.
<P>
Pressing and holding button 3 on the mouse (typically the right button)
will display an enlarged (depending on the size specified) version of the character
overlayed at the current pointer position.
<P>
The characters in the table are rendered in the font style and size selected 
for the text area. The anti-alias and fractional font metrics options are 
also honoured.
<P>
The following options can be specified:
<ul>
    <li><p>Show large character: displays a large representation of 
	the character under the cursor in the top-right hand corner of the
	window.</p></li>
    <li><p>Large character size: controls the size (in points) of the 
	large character.</p></li>
    <li><p>Show right-click character: displays a representation of the
	character under the cursor when the right-mouse button is pressed overlayed
	at the current cursor position.</p></li>
	<li><p>Right-click character size: controls the size (in points) of the 
	right-click character.</p></li>
	<li><p>Offset right-click character: offsets the position at which the
	right-click character is displayed so that it is easier to see other
	characters in the current characters rank and file.</p></li>
	<li><p>Table columns: controls the shape of the displayed table,
	by specifying the number of columns to be displayed. The table always
	consists of 256 characters, so specifying a column count of 16 will result
	in a row count of 16, a column count of 32 will result in a row count of 8, etc.</p></li>
	<li><p>Show status line: controls whether the status line at the bottom
	of the window is displayed. The status line contains the 
	character value, the character position in decimal and hexadecimal radicies and
	the unicode name of the character.
	If the UTF8 encoding is specified the number of bytes forming the character
	is displayed together with their values.</p></li>
	<li><p>Show encoding combo box: Controls whether the encoding combo box
	is displayed. By default the encoding is selected from the encoding specified
	for the currently selected buffer.</p></li>
	<li><p>Show unicode blocks combo box: Controls whether the unicode blocks combo box is displayed.
	The blocks combo box is only enabled when editing a Unicode or UTF8 buffer or when either encoding
	has been specified in the encoding combo box.</p></li>
	<li><p>Always use anti-aliasing: If set, the character glyphs are always
	rendered anti-aliased (smoothed). If not set the anti-aliasing options are
	taken from the Global Options -> Text Area settings.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
Typically usage:
<ul>
    <li><p>Floating map: when used as a floating character map,
	enable display of all controls and specify either 16 or 32 table columns</p></li>
	<li><p>Docked map: when used as a docked character map,
	disable display of all controls and specify 32 or 64 table columns
	if docked at the top or bottom or specify 4 or 8 table columns if
	docked at the left or right.</p></li>
</ul>
