<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>In the beginning of 2003 I found the <b>phpeclipse</b> project, a plugin to do php in <b>Eclipse</b>.
  I worked on it, and finaly wrote an alternative php parser for the project.
  The matter is that I don't like SWT very much so when I discovered discovered jEdit
  I loved it. So I decided to write a plugin using my php parser.
  It uses ErrorList plugin to show the errors and Sidekick plugin to manage parser.
</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<h3>Parsing</h3>

<p>
  The parser is now launched by Sidekick plugin. You can ask to reparse the file with the "parse buffer" action of
  Sidekick.
  You can choose to enable parse on keystroke within Sidekick, it should be slower, but with good computer there will be
  no problem.
  It supports php5 if you activate it in the options panel.
</p>

<h3>Project management</h3>

<p>
  The project management is a feature that will allow you to describe a project. A project is a group of files (under a
  root folder). It supports VFS so you can
  have a root on a ftp for example. To manage project please open the dockable view.
  When you create a project you'll have to choose a root folder. After that, click on the "reparse" button. It will
  parse all php files in your project
  and keep track of them in memory (you can show the parsing progress in the jEdit's IO threads). Of course, each time
  you'll open a file in your project and
  work on it, this file will be updated in the project memory. But only files under your root will be added.
  This feature will be useful for code completion (there is a little but I hope I'll add a lot more after), and for code
  browsing
</p>

<h3>Code Browsing</h3>
The parser will provide a Sidekick structure view of you file, to show it, use the "Structure browser" of Sidekick
plugin.
There are also 3 actions to browse php code : Find class, Find method and Find in file. Those actions will work if you
have a project up to date.
It will display a small dialog working like OpenIt plugin (I took a lot of ideas from this plugin), and you'll be able
to do incremental search on classes, methods,
displaying a little list of matching class or methods (depends on action you choosed). When you select one, the file
will be opened at the good position.
<h3>Code completion</h3>

<p>
  I added some code completion, but it doesn't work very well for the moment. To enable it, please use the action "Show
  completion popup" from Sidekick.
  There are completion after the following situation :
  <ul>
    <li><b>extends</b></li>
    <li><b>new </b></li>
    <li><b>$this-></b></li>
    <li><b>AnyClass::</b></li>
  </ul>
  The completion will work better with a project too, for example after <b>new</b> and <b>extends</b>, I will display
  all classes in the project.
  After <b>$this-></b> I'll display methods and fields of the class and superclasses.
  After <b>AnyClass::</b> I'll display methods of the class and superclasses ...
</p>

<h3>Code analysis</h3>

<p>
  There are some code analysis but you should be very careful because it's far from being perfect. If a variable is
  given to a
  method and is assigned by reference, the parser will not know that and report it as variable used but not assigned ...
</p>

<h2>known issue</h2>
<ul>
  <li>when you deactivate the parser the errors aren't removed from ErrorList (but is it really a bug or a feature
    ?)</li>
  <li>When you have several classes or methods with the same name in the project only one is kept in the project
    memory</li>
</ul>
