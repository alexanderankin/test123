   <h2>Antlr Plugin</h2>
   <p>ANTLR (ANother Tool for Language Recognition) is a powerful parser generator 
   for reading, processing, executing, or translating structured text or binary files. 
   It's widely used to build languages, tools, and frameworks. From a grammar, ANTLR 
   generates a parser that can build and walk parse trees.</p>
	<p>This plugin makes the Antlr parser and runtime library jar available as a 
	dependency for other plugins to use.</p>
