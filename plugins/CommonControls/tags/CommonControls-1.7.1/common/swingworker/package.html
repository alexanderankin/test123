<html><body><p>Java 5 SwingWorker class (deprecated)</p>
<p> These classes were added to CommonControls so that jEdit could use them and still
support pre-1.5 versions of the JRE. Since jEdit now requires JRE 1.7, these classes are older versions of those that are maintained in the JRE. Therefore, it is better to use javax.swing.SwingWorker. </p>
