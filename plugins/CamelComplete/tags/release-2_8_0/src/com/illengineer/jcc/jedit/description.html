This plugin provides a "CamelComplete Word" command for jEdit. This can
expand abbreviations into their full words as shown by these examples,
which show identifiers and their abbreviations:

    SwingUtilities -> SU
    GtkMessageBox -> GMB
    IOException -> IOE

The plugin also comes with a Regular Expression parser, so that you can
break words apart using a regexp. This is useful for C and Lisp, among
others.

    Regexp: [_-]

    gtk_check_menu_item_set_inconsistent -> gcmisi
    gtk_menu_item_new -> gmin
    multi-define-syntax -> mds
    
In its default, Simple Mode, the plugin will work with CamelCase and
underscore-separated words. Almost anything is configurable using its
Advanced Mode.
