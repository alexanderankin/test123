<h2>CamelComplete Plugin for JEdit<br>

</h2>



<br>



This plugin provides a "CamelComplete Word" command for jEdit. This can
expand abbreviations into their full words as shown &nbsp;by these
examples, which show identifiers and their abbreviations:<br>



<pre>	SwingUtilities 	-&gt; SU<br>	GtkMessageBox 	-&gt; GMB<br>	IOException	-&gt; IOE<br>	G_ModelScan	-&gt; GMS<br>	G_modelScan	-&gt; GmS<br>	G3openFile	-&gt; GoF<br>	_kml_openFile	-&gt; koF</pre>


The plugin also comes with a Regular Expression parser, so that you can
break words apart using a regexp. This is useful for C and Lisp, among
others.<br>


<pre>Regexp: [_-]<br><br>	gtk_check_menu_item_set_inconsistent -&gt; gcmisi<br>	gtk_menu_item_new 		     -&gt; gmin<br>	multi-define-syntax 		     -&gt; mds</pre>


To use this command, configure the plugin on the Options... screen,
described below, and then invoke the CamelComplete Word action. You can bind
this to a shortcut key by going to Utilities -&gt; Global Options -&gt;
Shortcuts.<br>
<br>
<h3>Options</h3>
The fundamental concepts are engines, providers, tokenizers, and option sets.<br>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>An <span style="font-style: italic;">Engine </span>is an object
that keeps track of a list of identifiers and the abbreviations used to
find those identifiers. An engine comprises a number of providers,
along with a few options that apply to the whole engine.</li>
  <li>A <span style="font-style: italic;">Provider</span> is a program
that generates a list of identifiers for an engine to remember. The
providers that come with the plugin include one that reads the output
of Ctags(see  <a href="http://ctags.sourceforge.net/">http://ctags.sourceforge.net/</a>) files, a JAR reader, a plain text file reader, and a provider that collects identifiers from all open buffers.</li>
  <li>A <span style="font-style: italic;">Tokenizer</span> is what
takes an identifier and determines the abbreviation that should be
used. The two available are one for CamelCase words, and one that uses
a supplied regular expression to break apart an identifier.</li>
  <li>An <span style="font-style: italic;">Option Set</span> is a group
of providers and their associated tokenizers. You can use option sets
to remember settings that you might want to use over and over in a
number of engines.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3>Interface</h3>
The options pane started out simple, but now looks like a labyrinth of buttons. Ah well.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Engines</span><br>
On the top is a combo box with the engines you've created, along with
buttons for editing that list. Having multiple engines is useful
because each can be updated or deleted independently.<br>
<br>
<h3>Option Groups</h3>
Along the left is a combo box and buttons for working with options groups<br>

<ul>
  <li>Saving a Group: &nbsp;use the options controls to set up your
providers, and then type a name in the Option Groups combo box, and
click Save.</li>
  <li>Loading a Group: &nbsp;choose a saved group from the combo box, and click Load.</li>
  <li>Deleting a Group: &nbsp;choose a saved group from the combo box, and click Delete.</li>
  <li>New Group: &nbsp;this button is a convenient way to clear all the provider and tokenizer fields.</li>
  <li>Append a Group: the currently selected option set will be appended to your list of providers.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Provider &amp; Tokenizer Lists</span><br>
The options pane has two lists, one for providers&nbsp;and one for
tokenizers. Each provider can have
multiple tokenizers working on it--this is useful in cases in which one
file has words formatted like GtkMessageBox and gtk_message_box_new.
The way the plugin determines which tokenizer is valid is by using the
"minimum" and "maximum parts" field. If a word's abbreviation is not
within this range of characters, the abbreviation will be considered
invalid and discarded.<br>


<h4>Creating a Provider</h4>
To create a new provider, choose one of the provider radio buttons and
either give a filename (Ctags, JAR, and Text),&nbsp;a snippet of
BeanShell code, or a regex to find words in buffers. Next, go to the
Tokenizers section and add one or more tokenizers to the list. The
regex field is for you to type the regular expression using which an
identifier is split up. If you type in an invalid regex, the default
value of <span style="font-family: monospace;">&nbsp;[_-] </span>(underscore and dash) will be used. Click Add to see the tokenizer in the list. <br>


<br>


Below tokenizers are options that apply to the whole provider.<br>


<ul>


  <li>Provider Ignore Case -- this stores identifiers in such a way
that both "AIOOBE" and "aioobe", or any case combination between, will
expand to "ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException".</li>


  <li>Filter Regexp -- any identifier matching this regular expression will not be considered for inclusion.</li>


  <li>Minimum and Maximum Parts -- described above, as a way to choose which tokenizer works.</li>


</ul>


When you've set all these options, click "Save" next to the provider
list, and you'll see it appear. To Edit an existing provider, select
it, click Edit, make your changes, and click Save.<br>
<br>
*If you're working with multiple engines, remember to click "Save" next to the engine name to save your changes*<br>
<br>
<h3>Global Options</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Popup List Rows -- how big should the completion popup be?</li>
  <li>Cache Data -- the engines will be serialized to disk in your
JEdit settings directory. This can take a few seconds on startup and
shutdown, but then you won't have to worry about keeping your original
sources around.</li>
  <li>Update on Startup -- if you choose not to cache the data, you can
have your providers load their lists when the plugin starts up. You
might do this because it's usually faster than the cache data option.</li>
</ul>


<br>


<h4>Updating the Engine</h4>


Now that you've set up your providers, click "Update Engine" to have
the plugin parse the sources and remember the identifiers. When you
start jEdit, the plugin will load the list of identifiers you were
using last. <br>


<span style="font-style: italic;">Note that clicking Save in the options window will </span>not <span style="font-style: italic;">cause the identifiers to be reloaded. You must click Update Engine.</span><br>


<br>
<h3>Tips</h3>
The Buffer Words provider is very useful, and will scan through all
open buffers for words defined by the regexp you supply. However, as
the buffers change you might want to rescan often, or even before every
completion. What you can do is:<br>
<br>
<ol>
  <li>In the Options dialog, make a new engine, which we'll name "Buffers".</li>
  <li>Choose the Buffer Words provider and use a good regexp like <span style="font-family: monospace;">\w{4,} </span>in the regex field.</li>
  <li>Add some tokenizers, like CamelCase and Regex "_".</li>
  <li>Save the Provider.</li>
  <li>Save the Engine.</li>
  <li>Now we'll make a macro that will update this engine and bind a keystroke to that macro.</li>
  <li>Create a file "Update_Buffer_Words.bsh" in the macros directory of your JEdit settings.</li>
  <li>Put this line in it<br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-family: monospace;">com.illengineer.jcc.jedit.CamelCompletePlugin.processConfiguration("Buffers");<br>
    </span></li>
  <li>If you want the macro to open the completion popup as well, you can use two lines:<br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-family: monospace;">com.illengineer.jcc.jedit.CamelCompletePlugin.processConfiguration("Buffers");<br>
    </span><span style="font-family: monospace;">com.illengineer.jcc.jedit.CamelCompletePlugin.complete(view, textArea);<br>
    </span></li>
  <li>Now bind a shortcut key to that macro, and you can easily reload all the words in open buffers.</li>
</ol>
