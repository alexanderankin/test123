This plugin provides a "CamelComplete Word" command for jEdit. This can
expand abbreviations into their full words as shown &nbsp;by these
examples, which show identifiers and their abbreviations:<br>

<pre>	SwingUtilities 	-&gt; SU<br>
	GtkMessageBox 	-&gt; GMB<br>
	IOException	-&gt; IOE<br>
</pre>

The plugin also comes with a Regular Expression parser, so that you can
break words apart using a regexp. This is useful for C and Lisp, among
others.<br>

<pre>Regexp: [_-]<br>
<br>
	gtk_check_menu_item_set_inconsistent -&gt; gcmisi<br>
	gtk_menu_item_new 		     -&gt; gmin<br>
	multi-define-syntax 		     -&gt; mds</pre>
