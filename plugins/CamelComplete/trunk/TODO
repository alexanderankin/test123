-Use reflection in the Jar provider to read method names. (maybe?)
  It's not too hard, but the identifier list would be gigantic.
-A solution, for the long term: use some sort of database, like BerkeleyDB,
 to maintain the identifier hashes in the CompletionEngines, rather than
 HashMaps. This would allow completion to scale to huge identifier sets,
 such as would be required if all Java method names were saved.
