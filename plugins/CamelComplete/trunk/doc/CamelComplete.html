<h2>CamelComplete Plugin for JEdit<br>
</h2>


<br>


This plugin provides a "CamelComplete Word" command for jEdit. This can
expand abbreviations into their full words as shown &nbsp;by these
examples, which show identifiers and their abbreviations:<br>


<pre>	SwingUtilities 	-&gt; SU<br>	GtkMessageBox 	-&gt; GMB<br>	IOException	-&gt; IOE<br>	G_ModelScan	-&gt; GMS<br>	G_modelScan	-&gt; GmS<br>	G3openFile	-&gt; GoF<br>	_kml_openFile	-&gt; koF</pre>

The plugin also comes with a Regular Expression parser, so that you can
break words apart using a regexp. This is useful for C and Lisp, among
others.<br>

<pre>Regexp: [_-]<br><br>	gtk_check_menu_item_set_inconsistent -&gt; gcmisi<br>	gtk_menu_item_new 		     -&gt; gmin<br>	multi-define-syntax 		     -&gt; mds</pre>

To use this command, configure the plugin on the Options... screen,
described below, and then invoke the CamelComplete Word. You can bind
this to a shortcut key by going to Utilities -&gt; Global Options -&gt;
Shortcuts.<br>

<br>

<h3>Options</h3>

The options pane has two lists, one for providers (where the plugin
finds the identifiers to use) and one for tokenizers (the mini-programs
used to find abbreviations for identifiers). Each provider can have
multiple tokenizers working on it--this is useful in cases in which one
file has words formatted like GtkMessageBox and gtk_message_box_new.
The way the plugin determines which tokenizer is valid is by using the
"minimum parts" field. If a word's abbreviation is less than this
value, the abbreviation will be considered invalid and discarded.<br>

<h4>Creating a Provider</h4>

To create a new provider, choose either Ctags (see <a href="http://ctags.sourceforge.net/">http://ctags.sourceforge.net/</a>)
or JAR (a standard Java JAR) and Choose the filename. Next, go to the
Tokenizers section and add one or more tokenizers to the list. The
regex field is for you to type the regular expression using which an
identifier is split up. If you type in an invalid regex, the default
value of <span style="font-family: monospace;">&nbsp;[_-] </span>(underscore and dash) will be used. Click Add to see the tokenizer in the list. <br>

<br>

Below tokenizers are options that apply to the whole provider.<br>

<ul>

  <li>Provider Ignore Case -- this stores identifiers in such a way
that both "AIOOBE" and "aioobe", or any case combination between, will
expand to "ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException".</li>

  <li>Filter Regexp -- any identifier matching this regular expression will not be considered for inclusion.</li>

  <li>Minimum Parts -- described above, as a way to choose which tokenizer works.</li>

</ul>

When you've set all these options, click "Save" next to the provider
list, and you'll see it appear. To Edit an existing provider, select
it, click Edit, make your changes, and click Save.<br>

<br>

<h4>Updating the Engine</h4>

Now that you've set up your providers, click "Update Engine" to have
the plugin parse the sources and remember the identifiers. When you
start jEdit, the plugin will load the list of identifiers you were
using last. <br>

<span style="font-style: italic;">Note that clicking Save in the options window will </span>not <span style="font-style: italic;">cause the identifiers to be reloaded. You must click Update Engine.</span><br>

<br>

<h3>Option Groups</h3>
Often you'll use different sets of providers for different tasks, and
Option Groups makes it easy to save a set of providers under a name. <br>
<ul>
  <li>Saving a Group: &nbsp;use the options controls to set up your
providers, and then type a name in the Option Groups combo box, and
click Save.</li>
  <li>Loading a Group: &nbsp;choose a saved group from the combo box, and click Load.</li>
  <li>Deleting a Group: &nbsp;choose a saved group from the combo box, and click Delete.</li>
  <li>New Group: &nbsp;this button is a convenient way to clear all the provider and tokenizer fields.</li>
</ul>
Remember to click "Update Engine" once your done setting up your group!
<h3>Room for Improvement</h3>

<ul>

  
  <li>Write an IdentifierProvider to collect words from currently opened buffers.</li>

  <li>Use reflection in the Jar provider to read method names.</li>
</ul>
