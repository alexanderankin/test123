Only the Quickstart is given here.

<h3>Quickstart</h3>

The one-minute quickstart to using CamelComplete is to

<ol>
<li>Install CamelComplete from JEdit’s Plugin Manager
<li>Ensure that Simple Mode is selected in the plugin’s options
<li>Bind CamelComplete-&gt;Simple Complete to an easy shortcut from
JEdit’s general preferences. This configuration will work for languages
like C and Java, that use either “CamelCase” notation, or underscore
separators. To have CamelComplete work with other types of identifiers,
you’ll need to delve into Advanced Mode, which is detailed in the manual.
</ol>
