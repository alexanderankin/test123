<h1>Log Viewer Plugin</h1>
<h2>
POPUP MENU

The popup menu items should be self-explanatory:
<table>

<td>
<ul>
<li>Open Log: open a log file.</li>
<li>Close Log: close a log file.</li>
-
<li>Refresh: useful if latency is set to a high number.</li>
<li>Reload: same as close then open.</li>
<li>Jump to First Line</li> 
<li>Jump to Last Line</li>
<li>Tail: toggles auto scroll on and off for the current log.</li>
<li>Find: display a "find" dialog.</li>
-
<li>Wrap Lines: in table view, wraps cell contents.</li>
-
<li>Clear Log: just clears the log window, does not alter the log file.</li>
<li>Clear All Logs: clears all log windows, does not alter the log files.</li>
<li>Delete Log: deletes the current log file from disk.</li>
<li>Delete All Logs: deletes all open log files from disk.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
Refresh vs. Reload
</h3>

<ul>
  <li><b>Refresh</b> is useful when the latency period is set to a high value. 
  You may want to see if anything new has been added to the log file before 
  the end of the latency period has been reached.  The refresh button will 
  force a read of the log file.</li>
  <li><b>Reload</b> is useful when the log file has been deleted or rolled,
  then recreated, as is often the case with webserver log files.  Reload
  will drop the current file handle and fetch a new one, then reread the
  entire file.</li>
</ul>
