LogViewer displays log files in a text area and can tail the log file much
like the Linux "tail -f " utility.  In addition, LogViewer can be configured to perform finely detailed parsing of log files, so that only the relevant entries are displayed, and can split entries into columns for display in a table.  The table display allows sorting by one or more columns and allows the columns themselves to be rearranged.
