<!ELEMENT logs (log*)>

<!--
    The "log" element contains the description for a specific type of log
    file.  Logs can be identified by either a file name glob (a regular
    expression used to match the file name), a first line glob (a regular
    expression used to match the first line of the file), or both.
    
    The "log" element also contains elements that will be used to parse the
    individual log entries and labels to be used for each column.
    
    All "log" elements must be named.

<!ATTLIST log name #REQUIRED>

<!--
    A regular expression used to match the log file name, for example,
    "weblogic.*" would match filenames like "weblogic.log", "weblogic.log00001",
    and so on.
-->
<!ELEMENT file_name_glob (#CDATA)>

<!--
    A regular expression used to match the first line of the log file, for
    example, "####*" would match 
    "####Aug 2, 2005 12:54:08 PM PDT INFO Server started."

<!--
    A "column" is the name of a column in a log file, like "Timestamp" or
    "Severity".  A log file may have a fixed width layout, if so, the width of
