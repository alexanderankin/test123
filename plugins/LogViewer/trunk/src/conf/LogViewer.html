<h3>
What Is Buffer Size?
</h3>
  Buffer Size is the number of characters which log viewer
  reads from a file each time it pulls characters from that file.
  High values will increase the performance of log viewer, but
  will consume more RAM.
<h3>  
What Is Latency?
</h3>

  Latency is the number of milliseconds which log viewer rests
  each time it reaches the end of a file before checking to see if anything
  has been added to that file.
  Latency values of lower than 1000ms (1 second) are not recommended, as they
  may cause performance problems (due to thrashing).
  
<h3>  
What Is Tab Placement?
</h3>

  Tab Placement dictates the location of the tabs within logviewer plugin.
  These tabs may be located at the Top, Bottom, Left, or Right side of the window.
  
<h3>  
What Is Confirm Delete?
</h3>

  When performing the Delete action, you may or may not want a dialog
  to appear asking you to confirm your intent to delete the contents
  of the currently selected file.
  By changing the value of this preference, you can control
  whether or not this dialog appears.
  
<h3>  
What Is Confirm Delete All?
</h3>

  When performing the Delete All action, you may or may not want a dialog
  to appear asking you to confirm your intent to delete the contents
  of all open files.
  By changing the value of this preference, you can control
  whether or not this dialog appears.

<h3>  
What Is Word Wrap?
</h3>

  The log file that you are viewing may have lines that are longer
  than the width of the viewable area of the log viewer. You may not
  want to scroll left and right to read the log. By changing the value
  of this preference, you can control whether long lines wrap to 
  several lines.
  
<h3>  
What Is Auto-Scroll?
</h3>

  When auto-scroll is enabled, log viewer automatically scrolls
  to the bottom of a followed file when new text is appended that file.
  
<h3>  
What Is Font?
</h3>

  You can choose a font to be used to show the text of the log.
