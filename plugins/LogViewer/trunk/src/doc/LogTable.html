<h2>Viewing log files in a table</h2>

Log files can be viewed in a table layout, which provides searching and sorting for a log file.  It is also possible to eliminate columns of a log file from view, thus eliminating a lot of "noise" that gets in the way of the important information.

To show a log file in a table, a definition for the log file must be created.  The definitions are stored in an xml file, the dtd describing that xml file is here:
