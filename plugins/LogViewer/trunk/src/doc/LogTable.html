<h2>Viewing log files in a table</h2>

Log files can be viewed in a table layout, which provides searching and sorting for a log file.  It is also possible to eliminate columns of a log file from view, thus eliminating a lot of "noise" that gets in the way of the important information.
<p>

To show a log file in a table, a definition for the log file must be created.  The definitions are stored in an xml file, the dtd describing that xml file is here:
<p>
<a href="logviewer.dtd.html">LogViewer DTD</a>
<p>
Here is an example:
<p>
<a href="logviewer.xml.html">LogViewer XML Example</a>
<p>
The definition file must be named "logviewer_types.xml" and must be stored in either your jEdit settings directory or in your home directory.
