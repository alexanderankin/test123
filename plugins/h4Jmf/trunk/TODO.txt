-dynamic menu's ?
-RTP , RTSP support ?
-using BeanShell scripting in actions ?
-docs/ dir ?
-javax.media.ResourceUnavailableEvent cannot open the audio device, inform user via pop-up?
-how can we get reference to running h4JmfPlugin-instance from BeanShell-script,from dockable h4Jmf JPanel? can we prevent dockable panel from being closed? if dockable panel is closed,reopened how to re-add  Player.getControlPanelComponent() ?
- move commands to play,pause,forward,backward,insert time,position to h4JmfPlugin itself
(so no more panel needed, will aso work if panel is closed, not docked!! 

-methods in h4JmfPlugin that work with Player, recall them from separate thread,
so gui-thread is not blocked!!
