cipher-description.wincrypt=With wincrypt you can protect data with \
                            your Windows Login information automatically. \
                            Data protected with this cipher is only \
                            decryptable if you are logged in with \
                            the same account and only if your password \
                            did NOT get reset by a system administrator. \
                            Optionally the data can be protected with \
                            an additional entropy like a password.
