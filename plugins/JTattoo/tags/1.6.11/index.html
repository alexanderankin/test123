        <h3 id="about" style="background:#7FB2FF">About JTattoo:</h3>
        <p>The JTattoo project home page is http://www.jtattoo.net/index.html. From 
        the JTattoo home page:</p>
        <p>JTattoo consists of several different Look and Feels for Swing 
        applications. All of them enables developers to improve their application 
        with an excellent user interface. So JTattoo opens desktop applications 
        the door to end users who are unfortunate with the Look and Feels 
        shipped with the standard JDK. </p>

        <p>Current Version: 1.6.11 October/27/2014</p>
        <p>Some of the features:
        <ul>
         <li>Extraordinality look with harmonic color themes</li>
         <li>Interactive feel with nice rollover effects</li>
         <li>Top performance through optimized paint algorithms</li>
         <li>Compact (about 1 MB jar file for all looks)</li>
         <li>Several different looks</li>
         <li>Customizeable through user defined themes</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
