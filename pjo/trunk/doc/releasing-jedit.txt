Packaging jEdit for release
==================================================

This document contains instructions on how to create and release jEdit for distribution, with all of the installers.

The analogous document for releasing plugins is in the jedit SVN repository under the name "pjo/doc/pjo.txt".

Release Workflow
================
Before you read this document, be sure to read first the README.SRC.txt, in the root source directory. It contains instructions on how to get and set up Apache Ant, what the targets mean, and what you need to build each kind of package.

Workflow
--------

1. Tag the sourcecode for release in the SVN repository by doing
        svn copy https://jedit.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/jedit/jEdit/branches/4.4.x https://jedit.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/jedit/jEdit/tags/jedit-4-4-pre2 -m "Tagging 4.4pre2 for release."
   with the correct version in the second URL and in the commit message

5. To be sure to work with the exact tagged source, check out the newly tagged source in a new directory by doing
        svn checkout https://jedit.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/jedit/jEdit/tags/jedit-4-4-pre2
   no matter where. You will find the source in a subfolder jedit-4-4-pre2 where you executed the command

6. Copy build.properties and jars/build.properties from your jEdit source directory to the newly created jedit-4-4-pre2 source directory. If you don't have the two, then create them. For the root directory you find a template called build.properties.sample there and for the jars/build.properties you find a template in build-support/build.properties. These are independent and have to be set up correctly. The one in the root directory is for jEdit itself, the one in jars is for the standard plugins.
   To give an example, in build.properties I customized the following properties:
    - wine.executable=wine
    - winepath.executable=winepath
    - innosetup.compiler.executable=/home/vampire/.wine/drive_c/Programme/Inno Setup 5/ISCC.exe
    - innosetup.via.wine=true
    - xsltproc.executable=xsltproc
    - docbook.xsl=/usr/share/xml/docbook/stylesheet/docbook-xsl
    - docbook.catalog=/usr/share/xml/docbook/schema/dtd/4.4/catalog.xml
    - fop.dir=/opt/fop-1.0
    - launch4j.dir=/opt/launch4j
   And in jars/build.properties I customized the following properties:
    - docbook.catalog=/usr/share/xml/docbook/schema/dtd/4.4/catalog.xml
    - docbook.xsl=/usr/share/xml/docbook/stylesheet/docbook-xsl
   You may not need to customize the same properties than me, e. g. if xsltproc is in your PATH environment variable, you may not need to customize xsltproc.executable.
   For further information about what you need to build the source, please read README.SRC.txt in the sources root directory.

7.1. Build the distribution files by doing
          ant dist
     in the jedit-4-4-pre2 directory
     In the newly created directory jedit-4-4-pre2/dist you find 8 files:
      - jedit4.4pre2manual-a4.pdf
      - jedit4.4pre2manual-letter.pdf
      - jedit4.4pre2source.tar.bz2
      - jedit4.4pre2install.jar
      - jedit-4.4pre2-noarch-1sao.tgz
      - jedit_4.4pre2_all.deb
      - jedit4.4pre2install.exe or jedit4.4pre2-dist-win-finish.tar.bz2
      - jedit4.4pre2install.dmg or jedit4.4pre2-dist-mac-finish.tar.bz2

7.2. If you have jedit4.4pre2-dist-win-finish.tar.bz2 in your jedit-4-4-pre2/dist folder you probably don't run a Windows box and don't have wine installed and set up, so please hand over this file to someone (e. g. <Björn "Vampire" Kautler> Vampire@jEdit.org) who does and ask him to unpack the file and run
          ant dist-win-finish
     and to hand over the resulting file jedit4.4pre2install.exe to you. The requirements for this are described in README.SRC.txt

7.3. If you have jedit4.4pre2-dist-mac-finish.tar.bz2 in your jedit-4-4-pre2/dist folder you probably don't run a Mac OS X box, so please hand over this file to someone (e. g. Björn "Vampire" Kautler <Vampire@jEdit.org>) who does and ask him to unpack the file and run
          ant dist-mac-finish
     and to hand over the resulting file jedit4.4pre2install.dmg to you. The requirements for this are described in README.SRC.txt

7.4. After you received the final distribution files jedit4.4pre2install.exe and jedit4.4pre2install.dmg you can delete jedit4.4pre2-dist-win-finish.tar.bz2 and jedit4.4pre2-dist-mac-finish.tar.bz2
