pjo To Do List
==============

:Date: $Date$
* Document how to package jedit installer itself.
* add a way to add additional files to package files
* add warnings if no dependencies found
* check that jEdit version number matches \d{2}\.\d{2}\.\d{2}\.\d{2}
* move tests into tests dir
* need a way to handle config (log level, directories, etc... maybe even what checks to run for which actions)
* bundle jv.py
* write a setup.py
* take a look at config-py for configuration
* move get_nv_from_path to pjolib
* need to do post packaging checksums
* maybe checks should just be a type of action, then running
  a checksums action as a 'post_check' would be more logical.
* check that no functionality was lost when switching from 
  pjo.Packager to actions.Package
* maybe remove PluginName-Version directory after 
  actions.Checkout, if it fails.
* write docs using the packaging sequence.
* add a check for generated archive integrity
* check return code from upload (scp,pscp)
* add a utility function for checking archives
* need a parameter for checkout for plugins whose CVS module name is different from the plugin name (Gestures vs GesturePlugin)

Wishes
======

* setup env, by checking deps
* inspect build file (prop name, prop values)
