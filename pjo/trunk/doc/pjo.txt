Since you are reading this document, you are probably interested in plugin packaging.
This must mean you have written a plugin, or fixed bugs in one, and want to release
it yourself.

In order to gain access to the tools and files that allow you to release plugins to the
general public, you must join the sourceforge project, 
`jedit-plugins`_.

 

Contact one of the administrators of this project to get assistance during your first 
plugin release. The admin will give you access to the tools and webpages that we use 
when we release plugins.


`pjo.py` is a Python_ script for packaging plugins for 
`jEdit Plugin Central`_.  This document is a guide to
using this script.

Packaging plugins can be a time-consuming and tedious task.
One must get get the source and any dependencies, review the
code, compile against the specified versions of jEdit and
plugins, create packages, and perform upload them three times to
three different places on sf.net.  `pjo.py`
is a `Python`_ script which cuts down on some of the grunt work.
It can checkout plugins from CVS or SVN, fetch dependencies, create
packages, verify JAR file integrity, ensure that required jars
are included in the created packages, perform Upload Step 1,
and verify package downloads.

In addition, this project serves as the documentation and
scripts repository for anything else related to packaging and
releasing plugins. Consider it always under development.

.. NOTE:: `pjo.py` works best with plugins that are
          consistently packaged.  For example, when the name
          of the plugin differs from the directory in CVS, it
          gets all out of joint.

Configuration
=============

Variables
---------

`DOWNLOAD`
    Directory to download plugins and version 
    of jEdit to.  May be specified using
    ``--download-dir`` parameter, or with 
    ``DOWNLOAD`` in your ".pjorc".
`INSTALL`
    Where jEdit versions are installed.
`MIRRORS`
    Space delimited sourceforge.net download mirrors.
    They are tried in order.  For example, ``aleron unc umn``.
`SETTINGS`
    Directory containing jEdit settings directories.
    Individual settings directories will be named 
    ``.version``, within this directory.  For 
    example, ``.4.2pre7``.
`TIMEOUT`
    Server timeout, used when downloading from sf.net.
`USERNAME`
    Sourceforge.net username.  This is used for cvs/svn checkouts
    and uploading packages.  If not specified, `pjo` will user
    your local username.

.pjorc
------

When run, `pjo` looks for a file named ``.pjorc`` in your home 
directory and the current directory, and if found "executes"
them in that order.  A ``.pjorc`` in your home directory is a
good way to keep default settings.

Here's an example:

.. include:: sample_pjorc
    :literal:

Note that any command-line arguments given to `pjo` override
anything in a ``.pjorc`` file.

Directory Structure
-------------------

`pjo` works with the following directory structure, where each
plugin is in its own directory, named ``<plugin-name>-<version>``,
however, `pjo` will create the plugin directories using the
`checkout` command, see `Downloading Source Code`_.

::

      FindFile-1.0/
        FindFile/
          build.xml
          ...
        FindFile.jar
      HeadlinePlugin-1.1.3/
        HeadlinePlugin/
          build.xml
      

Downloading and installing jEdit versions
=========================================

Each plugin needs to be tested against a specific 
version of jEdit, according to its dependencies.
To download and install a specific version of jEdit 
for pjo to use

    ./pjo.py -c download 4.3pre6
    ./pjo.py -c install 4.3pre6

This will download and install jedit 4.3pre6 in the 
DOWNLOAD_DIR indicated by your .pjorc file.
Note that the settings directories for each version
of jEdit will be in teh same location, in a directory
called `.4.3pre6` or `.4.2`.

          
Downloading Plugin Source Code
==============================

`checkout` (or `co`) checks out the source code for a plugin 
release from CVS. `checkout` creates a `<name>-<version>`
directory.

Usage::
    
  checkout <name>-<version> <tag>

Example::

  $ pjo.py -c co FindFile-1.0 rel-1-0
  
To checkout plugins from Subversion, use command `svnco`
instead. Everything else is the same.

  $ pjo.py -c svnco Highlight-1.4.1 V_1_4_1


Installing Plugins
==================

`install` (or `in`) can be used to install plugins required 
to build a plugin or a version of jEdit.

Usage::
    
    install <name>-<version> [<name>-<version>]+ <version>

Example:: (installing a plugin) 
    
    pjo.py -c install ErrorList-1.3.2 InfoViewer-1.2 4.2pre7

Example:: (installing jedit 4.2 pre7 (the editor)
    
    pjo.py -c install 4.2pre7

For install to work, you must have defined ``INSTALL``, 
``SETTINGS``, ``MIRRORS``, and ``DOWNLOAD``.


Compiling
=========

It's easiest when plugin authors use properties
``jedit.install.dir`` and ``install.dir``, and targets
``clean`` and ``dist`` exist.  Then one can do::

   ant -Djedit.install.dir=C:/jEdit/4.2pre11 \
       -Ddocbook.xsl=C:/Share/docbook-xsl-1.65.1 \
       -Dinstall.dir=c:/.4.2pre11/jars \
       clean dist clean
  
       
However, often these properties are named something else.
Also, if settings are not respectively ``../..`` and ``..``,
those should be set as the default.

In general, if you are packaging a plugin for someone else
and the ``build.xml`` file is old and doesn't work properly, feel
free to re-write it as a ``build.xml`` file that takes advantage
of the ``build-support`` plugin project (on the CVS
server as ``plugins/build-support``). 


Packaging
=========

`package` (or `pkg`) is one of `pjo`'s most useful commands.
It creates packages for a plugin. For `pkg` to package a
plugin, the plugin's jar file and all included jar files must
be located in the ``<name>-<version>`` directory -- on the
same level as the plugin's source code.

Usage: ``pkg <name>-<version>``

Example::
  
  2003-03-19$ pjo.py -c pkg JakartaCommons-0.4.2
  Packaging JakartaCommons 0.4.2
  Verifying jars... verifying JakartaCommons-0.4.2\bcel.jar
  verifying JakartaCommons-0.4.2\commons-collections.jar
  verifying JakartaCommons-0.4.2\commons-httpclient-2.0-rc2.jar
  verifying JakartaCommons-0.4.2\commons-logging.jar
  verifying JakartaCommons-0.4.2\JakartaCommons.jar
  loading properties...
  WARNING: no `docs` property
  verifying JakartaCommons-0.4.2\log4j.jar
  OK
  Verifying properties... OK
  creating JakartaCommons-0.4.2-bin.zip ... OK
  creating JakartaCommons-0.4.2.zip ... OK
  creating JakartaCommons-0.4.2-bin.tgz ... OK
  creating JakartaCommons-0.4.2.tgz ... OK
  creating CHECKSUMS... OK




Upload Step #1
==============

`upload` (or `up`) uploads one or more plugins' package files
to a "batch" directory as specified by the -b option.

.. NOTE: `upload` assumes that a batch directory will 
         already exist on the sf.net shell server, and that
         you have write permissions to it. If these are
         not true, you will get an error at this point.
         
         The directory it uploads to is of the form:
         
         ``/home/groups/j/je/jedit-plugins/batch-yyyy-mm-dd``.

Usage: ``upload -b yyyy-mm-dd <name-version> [<name>-<version>]+``

Example::

  2004-03-19 $ pjo.py -c upload -b 2006-03-19 JTools-1.6.2 
  Uploading JTools 1.6.2

  scp JTools-1.6.2/JTools-1.6.2.zip plugins.jedit.org:/home/groups/j/je/jedit-plugins/batch-2006-03-19/

  [..scp output...]

  
.. _sf.net: http://sf.net/


Help
====

To see all of `pjo`'s options, run ``pjo.py --help``::

  usage: pjo.py [options] [directory]+
  
  options:
    -h, --help            show this help message and exit
    -b <date>, --batch=<date>
                          Batch date (YYYY-MM-DD)
    -c COMMANDS, --command=COMMANDS
                          command to execute
    -i <dir>, --install-dir=<dir>
                          directory for jEdit installations
    -d <dir>, --download-dir=<dir>
                          directory for plugin and jEdit downloads
    -r <path>, --pjorc=<path>
                          pjorc file to run after defaults
    -s <dir>, --settings-dir=<dir>
                          directory containing .jedit directories
    -t <num>, --timeout=<num>
                          socket timeout, in seconds
    -u USERNAME, --username=USERNAME
                          sf.net username
    --debug               enable tracebacks in errors

To get help on commands, use the `help` command:

Usage: ``help [command]``.

Examples::

  $pjo.py -c help

  Documented commands (type help <topic>):
  ========================================
  EOF       download  exit    install  patch  upload
  checkout  svnco     env     export  package  props  verify
  
  Undocumented commands:
  ======================
  co  dl  help  in  pkg  up

To get help for a specify command, do::

  $ pjo.py -c help checkout
  get source, by tag, for a plugin from CVS (for preparing release)
  Usage: checkout directory tag


`jv.py`
=======

`jv.py` is a Python_ script that launches a version of jEdit
with a specific settings directory for that version.  If the
desired version of jEdit is not installed, it will attempt to
download and install it before running it.

Example::
    
    jv.py 4.2pre11

.. Note:: If installing on Windows, the installation of
          jEditLauncher will throw up a couple of dialogs
          that you must respond to.

Tips
====

If you have to modify a `build.xml` file, send a patch
to the author of the plugin.  This way the next person
to package the plugin may not have to do the same thing.

On Windows (at least w/my version `cvs`_) sometimes files
that have Windows line endings (\r\n) end up getting double.
I assume cvs is converting from Unix to Windows line endings
which double-spaces files.  This can screw up things like
property files where property values span multiple lines.

Upload Step 2 
=============

Now the packaged files need to be uploaded to the "incoming" 
directory on sf.net. This is in preparation for releasing the
files.

From plugins.jedit.org, in the batch directory you uploaded your
packaged files to, ncftp to upload.sf.net (as anonymous), 
cd to "incoming", and upload all package files.

Example::
    
  /home/groups/j/je/jedit-plugins/batch-2006-03-18> ncftp ftp://upload.sf.net/incoming
  Login successful.
  Logged in to upload.sf.net.
  Current remote directory is /incoming.
  ncftp /incoming > mput *

Once they're uploaded using the sf.net project site, you can
create the releases, and assign the files for the releases.

Upload Step 3 - Submitting files
================================

Now we are ready to submit the files to sf.net and all of its
mirrors, which involves filling out a web form on the 
sf.net jedit-plugins `File Releases`_.

As you create releases in the web form,
you select checkboxes next to files listed in the
uploads directory, and the sf.net file release system sucks
them up and distributes them to all the mirrors.


.. Hint:: After Upload #3, you have a webpage with 4 new
          files to describe. This file submission page creates 
          one <form> on the page for each file, which is
          a very icky user interface. At first, I was 
          setting the two combo boxes for each file, 
          clicking the submit button, and waiting for
          a response, repeating 4 times.

          In fact, if you set all 8 combo boxes, and 
          then click each of the 4 submit buttons
          within a half-second of each other, you can submit the values of all 4 forms in one
          shot. Sometimes it misses one, and then you gotta do it again, but it is still a huge
          timesaver.

PLUGIN MANAGER DATABASE
=======================

After submitting files to sf.net, you need to update and 
regenerate the plugin manager xml plugin list with 
knowledge of this new release. 

This is the data which is used to generate a `plugin list`_.

.. _plugin list: http://plugins.jedit.org/list.php 
.. _wiz: http://plugins.jedit.org/wiz

There are two branches for each plugin possible. If the plugin
has split into a 4.2final adn a 4.3preX version, then the
version that works for 4.2final should be the head of branch
"main" while the one that requires 4.3prex should be the head
of "devel" branch. If the plugin works for both versions, you
do not need two branches.

Go to `wiz`_ and update the database, adding
entries/dependency info for the plugin you just released. After you are finished,
you run this script:

  ``/home/groups/j/je/jedit-plugins/bin/generate-plugin-list``

This generates the plugin list that gets downloaded whenever you run the jedit plugin
manager. The information that is in the database determines which plugins are seen
by jedit plugin manager and which are not.
